Nervously. Uh, it's nothing. Go back to sleep. Zuko lies back down and Iroh sighs.
Looking up at Zuko. No, he wasn't.
You have more than one great-grandfather, Prince Zuko. Sozin was your father's grandfather. Cut to a bewildered Zuko. Your mother's grandfather was Avatar Roku.
Because understanding the struggle between your two great-grandfathers can help you better understand the battle within yourself. Zuko sits down, with his head facing down. Evil and good are always at war inside you, Zuko. It is your nature, your legacy. But, there is a bright side. Zuko looks up. What happened generations ago can be resolved now, by you. Because of your legacy, you alone can cleanse the sins of our family and the Fire Nation. Born in you, along with all the strife, is the power to restore balance to the world.
This is a royal artifact. It's supposed to be worn Zuko stands. by the Crown Prince.
Wondering. Where did you get these?
Seriously. Mmmm ... Takes a bite out of one of the cupcakes Zuko brought. The jam drips of his chin. In delight. ... mmmm!
Looks like you did some serious shopping. He picks up a big, gold-colored teapot. But where did you get the money?
To be honest with you He puts the pot down., the best tea tastes delicious whether it comes in a porcelain pot or a tin cup. Iroh walks over to Zuko and squats down beside him. I know we've had some difficult times lately. We've had to struggle just to get by. Places a hand on Zuko's shoulder who closes his eyes as if he was holding something back. But it's nothing to be ashamed of. There is a simple honor in poverty.
Zuko ... Sighs. Even if you did capture the Avatar, I'm not so sure it would solve our problems. Not now.
No, Zuko! You must never give in to despair. Allow yourself to slip down that road and you surrender to your lowest instincts. Zuko bows his head as he listens to his uncle's wisdom. In the darkest times, hope is something you give yourself. That is the meaning of inner strength.
Iroh's sad expression clears up as he hears Zuko talk. You did? Good, good.
Calling after Zuko. Wait!
Turns to one of Zuko's men and gives him the staff; casually. Hey, you mind taking this to his quarters for me?
Rubbing eyes and staring up at Appa in surprise. Duh? Huh?
Calmly. Good news for the Fire Lord. The Fire Nation's greatest threat is just a little kid.
This is what I've been missing. Who knew floating on a piece of driftwood for three weeks with no food or water, and sea vultures waiting to pluck out your liver could make one so tense? Looks at the clearly unhappy Zuko, walks over to him, and sits down on the ground. I see. It's the anniversary, isn't it?
I'm sure he doesn't. Why would he banish you if he didn't care? Zuko gets up and walks away; he grimaces soon after; to the massagers. Uh, that came out wrong, didn't it? They look at each other in confusion.
Holds up one shell. Look at these magnificent shells! Picks up a conch. I'll enjoy these keepsakes for years to come.
Clearly upset. To what do we owe this honor?
I'm sure your brother simply needs a moment.
Staring out the window thoughtfully. It is unbelievable. I have never known my brother to regret anything.
Turns to face Zuko and holds out arms in gesture. I care about you! And if Ozai wants you back, well, I think it may not be for the reasons you imagine.
Zuko, I only meant that in our family, things are not always what they seem.
Holding up his hand in motion and running down the staircase after Zuko. Wait! Don't leave without me!
Family sticks together, right? Lays hand on Zuko's shoulder.
Pushes several guards away; grabs one and wrestles him. Zuko! Let's go!
I think we're safe here.
Exhaling. Aahh! Cuts to shot of entire room where he and Zuko are seated at a low-lying table. See Prince Zuko, a moment of quiet is good for your mental well-being. Pours Zuko a cup of tea.
Well, I'm impressed. June cracks her whip. Cuts to shot of the shirshu bolting off the ship and racing down the dock. Very impressed. Leaning over the ledge of the ship with Zuko, stroking his beard thoughtfully; Zuko look at him, disgusted.
Apologetically. He means no offense! I'm certain you bathe regularly!
Plus, we'll pay your weight in gold.
Laughs with his hand on his stomach. You got it!
At my age, there's really only one big surprise left, and I'd just as soon leave it a mystery.
Nyla paralyzes Zuko as Iroh looks at Nyla in concern. June! No! Nyla tongue lashes out and hits June, who falls back into Iroh's arms.
Shhh.
You are pretty cute, my tiny nephew.
Pointing a finger above. Now I hope that you can see that each element has its own strengths and weaknesses. Sokka eats his fish. Iroh suddenly becomes very tall and raises his voice. But fire is the best!
My beloved Lu Ten, I will see you again.
Somehow, that's not so surprising. Groans.
Grimaces. Good. That was very ... uhhh ... bracing. He is handed another cup, which he throws out secretly behind his shoulder.
With the exact opposite of Zuko's thoughts. No, she's crazy, and she needs to go down. Zuko nods. Iroh grunts as he stands up. It's time to resume your training.
Lightning is a pure form of firebending, without aggression. It is not fueled by rage or emotion the way other firebending is. Some call lightning the cold-blooded fire. It is precise and deadly, like Azula. To perform the technique requires peace of mind.
Oh yeah, good point! I mean, yes. Outside. There is energy all around us. The energy is both yin and yang. Positive energy and negative energy. Only a select few firebenders can separate these energies. This creates an imbalance. The energy wants to restore balance, and in a moment the positive and negative energy come crashing back together, you provide release and guidance, creating lightning. Steps up, and generates lightning, and shoots it away from the two.
Remember, once you separate the energy, you do not command it. You are simply its humble guide. Breathe first.
I was afraid this might happen. You will not be able to master lightning until you have dealt with the turmoil inside you.
Zuko, you must let go of your feelings of shame if you want your anger to go away.
Prince Zuko, pride is not the opposite of shame, but its source. True humility is the only antidote to shame.
I have another idea. I will teach you a firebending move that even Azula doesn't know, because I made it up myself. Zuko smiles.
Fire is the element of power. Draws the firebending insignia in the dirt. The people of the Fire Nation have desire and will, and the energy to drive and achieve what they want. Earth is the element of substance. Draws the earthbending insignia. The people of the Earth Kingdom are diverse and strong. They are persistent and enduring. Air is the element of freedom. Draws the airbending insignia. The Air Nomads detached themselves from worldly concerns and found peace and freedom. Also, they apparently had pretty good senses of humor! Smiles broadly but returns to a more serious demeanor when Zuko doesn't react at all. Water is the element of change. Draws the waterbending insignia. The people of the Water Tribe are capable of adapting to many things. They have a deep sense of community and love that holds them together through anything.
It is important to draw wisdom from many different places. If you take it from only one place, it becomes rigid and stale. Divides the four insignias into separate sections. Understanding others, the other elements, and the other nations will help you become whole. Draws a circle around the insignias.
It is the combination of the four elements in one person that makes the Avatar so powerful. But it can make you more powerful, too. You see the technique I'm about to teach you is one I learned by studying the waterbenders.
Waterbenders deal with the flow of energy. A waterbender lets their defense become their offense, turning their opponents' energy against them. I learned a way to do this with lightning.
If you let the energy in your own body flow, the lightning will follow it. You must create a pathway from your fingertips, up your arm to your shoulder, then down into your stomach. The stomach is the source of energy in your body. It is called the sea of chi. Only in my case it is more like a vast ocean. Laughs. From the stomach, you direct it up again, and out the other arm. The stomach detour is critical. You must not let the lightning pass through your heart, or the damage could be deadly. You may wish to try a physical motion, to get a feel for the pathways' flow, like this. The two begin to practice the redirection motion. Now, are you focusing your energy? Can you feel your own chi flowing in, down, up, and out?
Come on, you've got to feel the flow. They practice the motion for a few minutes. Excellent! You've got it!
What, are you crazy? Lightning is very dangerous!
Yeah! But I'm not going to shoot lightning at you! If you're lucky, you will never have to use this technique at all!
Perhaps, a sporting game of Pai Sho!
Zhao has been promoted? Well, good for him! As Iroh makes a move in his Pai Sho game, another player slaps his hand against his own forehead as if he lost.
Iroh wins his game. Excellent! I take the pot! A crew member punches himself. But you're all improving! I'm certain you will win if we play again.
Is everything okay? It's been almost an hour and you haven't given the men an order.
Don't give up hope yet. You can still find the Avatar before Zhao.
Where have you been, Prince Zuko? You missed music night! Lieutenant Jee sang a stirring love song.
He is playing some sort of card game. He answers calmly while looking over the tile he's holding toward his nephew. I won't get to finish my game?
With continuing disinterest and an air of skepticism. Or it's just the celestial lights. We've been down this road before, Prince Zuko. He looks at the tile in his hand, depicting the symbol of airbending. I don't want you to get too excited over nothing. He places it on a tile carrying the symbol of firebending and gestures toward the open place at the other side of the table while continuing in a relaxed voice. Please, sit. Why don't you enjoy a cup of calming Jasmine tea?
I'm going to bed now. Yawns and stretches. Yep, a man needs his rest. After a short pause, he abandons his try at a veiled suggestion and delivers his request more clearly, his tone tired. Prince Zuko, you need some sleep. Even if you're right, and the Avatar is alive, you won't find him. Your father, grandfather and great-grandfather all tried and failed.
Sternly. Again.
Sighs while he gets up. No! Zuko lowers his arms and looks at his uncle. Power in firebending comes from the breath Iroh moves his both hand up in front of him to emphasize the breathing motion., not the muscles. He stretches his left arm out as if he was sending a fire blast. The breath becomes energy in the body. The energy extends past your limbs and becomes: fire! Iroh directs a fire blast at his nephew that evaporates just before it would scorch him. Get it right this time.
No, you are impatient. He sits down again on his chair. You have yet to master your basics. He yells his order. Drill it again!
Concedes reluctantly. On a dire tone. Very well, His expression changes completely to one of delight as he picks something up from the ground. but first, I must finish my roast duck. He quickly munches down the roast duck, much to the dismay of Zuko.
Cuts to Iroh who dotes over the flower. Zuko appears behind him. You're looking at the rare white dragon bush. Its leaves make a tea so delicious, it's heartbreaking. That, or it's the white jade, which is poisonous.
Dreamily. Hmm ... delectable tea? More suspiciously. Or deadly poison?
Zuko, Cut to a wide, overhead shot of Zuko standing behind Iroh. remember that plant I thought might be tea?
I did ... Turns around. and it wasn't. Reveals himself to be swollen and covered in red marks.
Surprisingly calmly. When the rash spreads to my throat, I will stop breathing. Excitedly. But look what I found. Iroh holds out his arm to reveal berries. These are bacui berries, known to cure the poison of the white jade. Unenthusiastically. That, or maka'ole berries that cause blindness.
But where are we going to go? Kneeling down and scratching his rash vigorously. We're enemies of the Earth Kingdom and fugitives from the Fire Nation. Camera zooms in on his reddened leg.
Rises. But if the Fire Nation discovers us, we'll be turned over to Azula.
The girl moves away from the camera's eye, revealing Iroh to be in an even worse condition than before with the rash having spread to his face and his cheeks swollen. Whoops!
Shoots him angry look. Cuts to shot of Song taking a lotion from a jar. She begins slathering it over the inflamed areas. Yes, my nephew was named after his father, so we just call him Junior. Leans over to the side to give Zuko a pleased smile.
Excitedly. Where do you live exactly?
Thank you for the duck. It was excellent.
Pats his stomach in a contented manner. Much practice.
Junior, where are your manners? You need to thank these nice people.
What are you doing? These people just showed you great kindness.
Ow ... That really hurt my tailbone.
Handing her a cup of tea. Here is your tea. Cuts to shot of Toph staring blankly at the ground and back to Iroh. You seem a little too young to be traveling alone.
Laughs. Perhaps I am.
I wasn't thinking that.
I poured your tea because I wanted to and for no other reason.
You sound like my nephew, always thinking you need to do things on your own, without anyone's support. There is nothing wrong with letting the people who love you help you. Not that I love you, I just met you.
I've been tracking him actually.
Looks away; slightly sad. Yes, a little bit. Cuts to shot of the rocky ledge where the two sit, the mountain region in the background; voice-over. His life has recently changed and he's going through very difficult times. He's trying to figure out who he is and he went away.
I know he doesn't want me around him right now, but if he needs me, I'll be there.
My pleasure. Sharing tea with a fascinating stranger is one of life's true delights.
I'm glad.
Get up!
I just want our place to look nice, in case someone brings home a lady friend! He gives Zuko a nudge with the elbow.
Life happens wherever you are, whether you make it or not. Now come on, I found us some new jobs, and we start this afternoon!
Uh, does this possibly come in a larger size? Cut to a view behind Iroh with the apron strings not quite long enough to tie.
Quickly holds the cup at a distance. Blech! Looks at it in disgust. This tea is nothing more than hot leaf juice!
Angrily. How could a member of my own family say something so horrible?! We'll have to make some major changes around here.
Would you like a pot of tea?
Pan across to Iroh through another window. "Sick of tea?" That's like being sick of breathing! He rummages through the cupboard beneath the counter, where he is standing. Close-up view of kettle. Have you seen the spark rocks to heat up the water?
View through window. Coming back to the counter. I borrowed our neighbors'. Such kind people.
Frontal view. The secret ingredient is love. He waves a hand through the steam coming from the teapot and walks toward the back of the shop where the owner is, while Zuko gives him a disgusted look.
Please, son, you're confused! You don't know what you're doing!
Panning view from behind Jet facing Iroh and Zuko. This poor boy is confused. We're just simple refugees.
Frontal view. Blushing. Oh, ho, ho. That's very sweet.
Many times I imagined myself here, at the threshold of the palace. Camera pans to show the Earth Kingdom Emblem above the palace doors. But I always thought I would be here as a conqueror. Instead, we are the Earth King's personal guests, here to serve him tea. Destiny is a funny thing.
Maybe the Earth King overslept.
Did I ever tell you how I got the nickname "The Dragon of the West"?
It's more of a demonstration, really.
Come on! You'll be fine!
I need your help.
May I come in? Toph nods, and he walks in before turning to the group. Princess Azula is here in Ba Sing Se.
She has captured my nephew as well.
I know how you must feel about my nephew. Moving forward to place his hands on Sokka's shoulders. But believe me when I tell you that there is good inside him.
I brought someone along who might help us.
Shrugging. None taken.
The key to both is proper aging. What's on your mind?
Perfection and power are overrated. I think you were very wise to choose happiness and love.
I don't know the answer. Sometimes, life is like this dark tunnel. You can't always see the light at the end of the tunnel, but if you just keep moving, Aang earthbends the rocks away one last time. Iroh's fire blows out. He smiles. you will come to a better place.
Zuko, it's time we talked. To Aang and Katara. Go help you other friends. We'll catch up with you. They walk away, Katara looks back at Zuko, who is looking sadly to the side, before moving on.
You're not the man you used to be, Zuko. Smiles. You are stronger and wiser and freer than you have ever been. And now you have come to the crossroads of your destiny. Close-up to Zuko's face. It's time for you to choose. It's time for you to choose good.
To Zuko. The kind of redemption she offers is not for you.
Zuko, I am begging you. Close-up of Zuko's face as he focuses from Azula back to Iroh. Look into your heart and see what it is that you truly want. Zuko resumes contemplating.
You've got to get out of here! I'll hold them off as long as I can! Fires some blasts at Zuko and Azula.
Ming places the tray of tea inside Iroh's cell. Thank you, Ming. Ever since I was put in here, you have been very kind to me.
Thank you, Ming. Your little gestures of kindness have made my days in prison bearable. Thinks for a moment and smiles. I think you should take the rest of the day off.
You don't look well. Maybe you should go home and rest.
Brief close-up of his face. Trust me. It is better that you are not here this afternoon.
No please, don't stop just for me!
Annoyed. What now?
Colonel Mongke! What a pleasant surprise!
Sure. Colonel Mongke and the Rough Rhinos are legendary. Each one is a different kind of weapon specialist. The camera cuts to each member of the Rough Rhinos. They are also a very capable singing group.
While rubbing his arm. Would you like some tea first? I'd love some. How about you, Kahchi? I make you as a jasmine man. Am I right?
It's nice to see old friends.
Grasping his shoulder again as he racks his brain in search of an answer. Hmmm ... Old friends that don't want to attack me ...
So do we. Pointing at something behind Zuko. Ah, this is interesting. I think I found our friend.
I don't think this is a gamble.
May I have this game?
Those who do can always find a friend.
I always tried to tell you that Pai Sho is more than just a game.
Places a hand on Zuko's shoulder to reassure him. He is. Just watch.
You must forgive my nephew. He is not an initiate and has little appreciation for the cryptic arts.
One who has eaten the fruit and tasted its mysteries.
I'm afraid it's members only. Wait out here.
Everything is taken care of. We're heading to Ba Sing Se.
We can hide in plain sight there. And it's the safest place in the world from the Fire Nation. Even I couldn't break through to the city. Happily shrugs his shoulders.
It's pronounced Mushi.
Approaches the ticket booth. Uh, no, no. But may I just say you're like a flower in bloom. Your beauty is intoxicating.
Waves hand. Ooh! Jasmine please.
Blaugh! Ugh, coldest tea in Ba Sing Se is more like it! What a disgrace!
Hey!
Mourning. I know you're not supposed to cry over spilled tea, but ... Sniffs. The cup is shown overturned in a puddle. it's just so sad!
What a handsome baby. Strokes the infant.
You did the right thing. Letting the Avatar's bison go free.
Zuko! Rushes to him.
You're burning up. Dips a cloth in water. You have an intense fever. Places the cloth on Zuko's forehead. This will help cool you down.
Grabs a bucket with a spoon in it; takes out the spoon. Here's some clean water to drink. Sits him up slightly. Stay under the blankets and sweat this out.
You should know that this is not a natural sickness, but that shouldn't stop you from enjoying tea. Feeds Zuko the tea.
Your critical decision. What you did beneath that lake. It was in such conflict with your image of yourself that you are now at war within your own mind and body. Feeds Zuko more tea.
You are going through a metamorphosis, my nephew. It will not be a pleasant experience, but when you come out of it, Takes a cloth and wipes Zuko's head. you will be the beautiful prince you were always meant to be.
It's jook. I'm sure you wouldn't like it.
Now that your fever is gone, you seem different somehow.
Who thought when we came to this city as refugees, that I'd end up owning my own tea shop? Follow your passion, Zuko, and life will reward you.
I am very thankful.
No. I'm thankful because you decided to share this special day with me. It means more than you know. The two embrace.
Overjoyed. Yes, let's make some tea!
I'm brewing as fast as I can!
Reads through, becomes shocked, and smiles. I ... I can't believe it!
Excited. Great news! We've been invited to serve tea to the Earth King! Runs off.
Good tea is its own reward.
Frontal view. Pao looks around, concerned. My own tea shop? This is a dream come true!
I even get to name the shop?
Did you hear, nephew? This man wants to give us our own tea shop in the Upper Ring of the city!
So, I was thinking about names for my new tea shop. How about the Jasmine Dragon? It's dramatic, poetic, has a nice ring to it.
Grabs the flyer. We have a chance for a new life here. Cut to Zuko looking out a window. If you start stirring up trouble, we could lose all the good things that are happening for us.
There is nothing wrong with a life of peace and prosperity. I suggest you think about what it is that you want from your life and why.
What that means is up to you. Zuko walks away. Continues brainstorming names for his new tea shop. The Tea Weevil! No, that's stupid.
So, the Blue Spirit. I wonder who could be behind that mask ...
I was just about to ask you the same thing. What do you plan to do now that you've found the Avatar's bison? Keep him locked in our new apartment? Should I go put on a pot of tea for him?
Starts yelling. And then what!? You never think these things through! Points at him. This is exactly what happened when you captured the Avatar at the North Pole! You had him, and then you had nowhere to go!
No! If his friends hadn't found you, you would have frozen to death!
Is it your own destiny, or is it a destiny someone else has tried to force on you?
I'm begging you, Prince Zuko! It's time for you to look inward and begin asking yourself the big questions. Who are you, and what do you want?
You did the right thing, nephew. Zuko looks at his Blue Spirit mask as Iroh rests a hand on its shoulder. Leave it behind.
Lady trouble?
As your guidance counselor, I can tell you that words of love are difficult to express. He looks above as his eyes narrow. They're like the clouds, always changing and shifting. Clouds roll in behind Iroh.
Who would have thought after all these years, I'd return to the scene of my greatest military disgrace ... Turns away for a second before turning back with a floral hat on his head. as a tourist!
What sort of king is he eating like?
So, Smellerbee. That's an unusual name for a young man.
Calling out to her. Oh, now I see. It's a beautiful name for a lovely girl!
It is a magnificent site.
Once. When I was a ... different man.
That's very noble of you. I believe people can change their lives if they want to. I believe in second chances.
Tersely. Be careful what you wish for, Admiral. History is not always kind to its subjects.
Sadly. I hope not, for your sake.
Secretly. We'll be landing soon. Do you have a plan?
It's almost twilight, Admiral. As your military consultant, I must advise you to halt your attack. Cuts to shot of the ship, sailing past a rising moon. The waterbenders draw their power from the moon, and it is nearly full tonight. You should wait and resume the attack at daybreak. Cuts back to Iroh and Zhao.
If you're fishing for an octopus my nephew, you need a tightly woven net, or he will squeeze through the tiniest hole and escape.
I'm sorry. I just nag you, because ... well, Voice breaking slightly. ever since I lost my son ...
... I think of you as my own.
Remember your breath of fire. It could save your life out there.
And put your hood up. Keep your ears warm!
I don't need to remind you we have a time limit. If we don't defeat the Water Tribe before the full moon rises, they will be undefeatable.
Shocked. Remove the moon? How?
What?
Somewhat angrily. Zhao, the spirits are not to be trifled with!
Off-screen. He is right Zhao.
Close-up of Iroh while he takes off his hood. I'm no traitor, Zhao, the Fire Nation needs the moon, too; we all depend on the balance. Whatever you do to that spirit I'll unleash on you ten-fold. Let it go, now!
Iroh notices Yue. You have been touched by the Moon Spirit. Close-up of Yue. Some of its life is in you.
I'm surprised Prince Zuko, surprised that you are not at this moment trying to capture the Avatar.
Then you should rest. A man needs his rest.
Disinterested. You mean the Avatar?
Bows back. Retired general.
Our ship is being repaired.
Iroh's eyes open wide in surprise, as he is addressed by Zuko. Yes. I will do that. He happily holds his hand up and relates enthusiastically. It was incredible! To Zuko, from the corner of his mouth in a confused tone. What? Did we crash or something?
Prince Zuko, show Commander Zhao your respect. Removes his hand from Zuko's shoulder as he faces Zhao while Zuko just slants his eyes. We would be honored to join you. Do you have any ginseng tea? It's my favorite.
Eh.. My fault, entirely.
Calmly with a hint of amusement in his voice. More tea, please.
Gets up as well; sternly. Prince Zuko, that's enough.
Camera pans slowly to the right to a full close-up of Zuko. Worried. Prince Zuko, have you forgotten what happened last time you dueled a master?
Remember your firebending basics, Close-up of Iroh's upper body. Prince Zuko. They are your greatest weapons.
Basics, Zuko! Close-up of Zuko's determined face. Break his root!
No, Prince Zuko. Do not taint your victory. Turns to face Zhao. Condescending. So this is how the great Commander Zhao acts in defeat? Close-up of Zhao lying on the floor. Disgraceful. Cut back to a closer shot of Zuko and Iroh. Even in exile, my nephew is more honorable than you. Zuko looks at Iroh upon hearing those last words. Switch to a shot from over Zhao's shoulders. Thanks again for the tea. It was delicious.
Smiling slyly, while glancing at his nephew. Of course. I told you ginseng tea is my favorite.
Close-up. I was never angry with you. I was sad because I was afraid you lost your way.
Releases him. But you found it again. Frontal view. And you did it by yourself. Frontal view of Zuko over Iroh's shoulder. And I am so happy you found your way here. Side-view. Hugs him again.
Hmmm ...
Close-up. No, Zuko, it won't turn out well.
Even if I did defeat Ozai, Close-up. and I don't know that I could, it would be the wrong way to end the war. Aerial view of the group. History would see it as just more senseless violence, a brother killing a brother to grab power. The only way for this war to end peacefully is for the Avatar to defeat the Fire Lord.
Close-up. No. Someone new must take the throne. An idealist with a pure heart Frontal view from the side of Iroh as the camera zooms in on Zuko. and unquestionable honor. It has to be you, Prince Zuko.
Yes, you have. Close-up of Iroh from over Zuko's shoulder. You've struggled; you've suffered, but you have always followed your own path. Close-up of Zuko. You restored your own honor, and only you can restore the honor of the Fire Nation.
Aerial view of group. Sozin's Comet is arriving, and our destinies are upon us. Aang will face the Fire Lord. Extreme close-up. When I was a boy, I had a vision that I would one day take Ba Sing Se. Cut to Zuko and the camera pans across to right showing Toph, Sokka, Suki, and Katara. Only now do I see that my destiny is to take it back from the Fire Nation, Extreme close-up. so the Earth Kingdom can be free again.
Yes. Close-up from over Zuko's shoulder. Zuko, you must return to the Fire Nation, so that when the Fire Lord falls, you can assume the throne and restore peace and order. Extreme close-up of Zuko. But Azula will be there, waiting for you.
Not alone! Frontal view of Iroh from the side of Zuko. You'll need help.
Close-up. What do you think it is?
Frontal view. After I re-conquer Ba Sing Se, I'm going to re-conquer my tea shop, and I'm going to play Pai Sho every day. Flips a Pai Sho piece and catches it as he speaks.
Close-up. Goodbye, everyone. Today, destiny is our friend. Whispers. I know it.
Cut to a shot of Iroh. Only once every hundred years can a firebender experience this kind of power.
Points at painting. Hey, my belly's not that big anymore. I've really trimmed down.
There is a storm coming. A big one.
A storm is approaching from the north. He turns to face Zuko. I suggest we alter our course and head southwest.
Cut to his face; stern. Prince Zuko, consider the safety of the crew.
Reassuringly, a twinge of uncertainty in his voice, almost as if he does not fully believe what he is saying. He doesn't mean that. He's just all worked up.
Pleasantly. Lucky guess.
Easy now. Both Zuko and Jee wrist-block the other's arm; smoke rises from a furious Zuko's hand. Interrupting the staredown, Iroh extends an arm and pulls theirs apart; the smoke fades. Enough! We're all a bit tired from being at sea so long. I'm sure after a bowl of noodles, everyone will feel much better.
Do you really want to know?
It's okay. May I join you?
Massages his beard. Try to understand. My nephew is a complicated young man. He has been through much.
Places his hands on Zuko's shoulders. Prince Zuko, what's wrong?
Leads Zuko away with his left hand still on his shoulder. You're not missing anything, trust me. These meetings are dreadfully boring.
Very well. But you must promise not to speak. Another elder soldier walks by them into the war chamber. These old folks are a bit sensitive, you know?
Zuko was right, you see, Massages his beard again. but it was not his place to speak out. And there were dire consequences. Slightly bows his head.
After Zuko's outburst in the meeting, the Fire Lord became very angry with him. Flashback quickly ends. He said the challenge against the general was an act of complete disrespect! And there was only one way to resolve this.
That's right. Zuko looked upon the old general he had insulted and declared that he was not afraid. But Zuko misunderstood. Flashback shows an overview of the chamber; the camera cuts to show Zuko preparing for the Agni Kai. When he turned to face his opponent, he was surprised to see it was not the general. Flashback shows the tippet that was on Zuko's shoulders fall down to the ground. Zuko had spoken out against the general's plan, but by doing so in the Fire Lord's war room, it was the Fire Lord whom he had disrespected. Frontal shot of a surprised Zuko; as the camera zooms in on him, his expression changes to one of fear. Zuko would have to duel his own father.
When Prince Zuko saw that it was his father who had come to duel him, he begged for mercy.
Voice-over; Iroh closes his eyes and averts his head to the left. I looked away.
It was no accident. After the duel, the Fire Lord said that by refusing to fight, Zuko had shown shameful weakness. As punishment, he was banished and sent to capture the Avatar. Only then could he return with his honor.
Things will never return to normal. But the important thing is the Avatar gives Zuko hope.
Look!
Then we must head directly into the eye of the storm.
Your apology is accepted.
Somewhat enthusiastically. Spare coins for weary travelers?
They will if you ask nicely. A peasant woman strolls past; somewhat dramatically. Spare change for a hungry old man?
The coin is appreciated, but not as much as your smile!
Standing up. Not professional anyway. He puts the hat down and stands up, swaying lightly as he begins to sing. It's a long, long way to Ba Sing Se, but the girls in the city, they look so pretty!
Singing. They kiss so sweet that you really got to meet the girls from Ba Sing Se!
Dramatically; close to tears. Such a kind man.
No, it's not a romantic picnic, but it is a special occasion. He hands a coin to the owner, and takes the basket. As he goes, he sees a vase that contains a moon flower. He slides the vase into the shade, which causes the flowers to bloom instantly. The moon flower likes partial shade. He bows to the shop owner and walks away.
He takes an instrument from the shop, and starts singing, walking toward the boy. Iroh gets down on one knee near the boy as he begins to sing. Leaves from the vine, falling so slow. Like fragile, tiny shells, drifting in the foam. Little soldier boy, come marching home. Brave soldier boy, comes marching home.
It is usually best to admit mistakes when they occur, and seek to restore honor.
But not this time. Run!
Confused. What are you doing?
Confused. With that stance?
He shakes his head. With a poor stance, you are unbalanced, and you can be easily knocked over. He quickly grabs the arm of the mugger and disarms him, while pushing his attacker and knocking him to the ground. He smiles, while twirling the dagger in his hand, and helps Tycho to his feet.
Hands the knife back to Tycho. With a solid stance, you are a much more serious threat. Iroh demonstrates a proper stance, which Tycho attempts to imitate, but is still not assuming the correct form. Iroh walks over to him and holds his head still while he adjusts the man's stance with a light kick. Much better! But to tell you the truth, you do not look like the criminal type.
Of course!
Smiling. While it is always best to believe in oneself, a little help from others can be a great blessing.
Happy birthday, my son. Cut to his face, as he starts to cry. If only I could have helped you. He sings, but his voice cracks due to him crying. Leaves from the vine, falling so slow. Like fragile, tiny shells, drifting in the foam. Little soldier boy, come marching home. Brave soldier boy, comes marching home.
Cut to a shot of the girl. You're right, Zuko. I've seen that girl in here quite a lot. Seems to me she has quite a little crush on you.
Before the stunned Zuko can respond. He'd love to!
How was your night, Prince Zuko?
Pushes open the door completely and enters the room, holding a rolled up scroll in his hands. Well, there is news, Prince Zuko, but you might not like it. Don't get too upset.
Frontal view of Zuko, Iroh tugging his small beard in the background. Okay then. Hesitatingly. We have no idea where he is.
You really should open a window in here.
Well, there have been multiple sightings of the Avatar, but he is impossible to track down.
Casually points at the smoking fish in front of him. Are you going to finish that?
Singing. Winter, spring ... Summer, and fall ... Winter, spring ... Summer, and fall ... Four seasons ... four loves ... Four seasons ... for love.
No, it's about our plans. There's a bit of a problem.
I'm afraid so. He's taking everyone ... Putting his arm over his face in woe. even the cook.
Cuts to a furious Zuko. Zuko charges at Zhao in anger, but Iroh cuts him off. No!
Just rumors. I don't think he is real.
Cut to a shot of Prince Zuko lying in bed in the foreground of his cabin. The door opens and Iroh sticks his head in. Entering. The crew wanted me to wish you safe travels.
It's a lovely night for a walk. Why don't you join me? It would clear your head. No response. Or just stay in your room and sit in the dark. Whatever makes you happy.
Zuko! Runs back to see the ship destroyed. Zuko ...
The Fire Lord will not be pleased when he learns who was responsible.
Yes ... pirates. We had a run-in with them a while back. They wanted revenge.
Yes, I accept. It will be an honor to serve as your general. To the Fire Nation!
Our plan is working perfectly. Zhao doesn't suspect a thing.
No nephew of mine is going to stow away on a ship without some backup.
Someone's coming. Stay hidden until we get to the North Pole and the Avatar will be yours. Good luck. The two head their separate ways.
Actually, someone did. I assure you, it is a matter of utmost importance, Prince Zuko. Scratches beard.
Even more urgent. It seems, I- Rubs forehead in stress. -I have lost my lotus tile. Moves a piece of his across the Pai Sho board.
For my Pai Sho game. Most people think the lotus tile insignificant, but it is essential for the unusual strategy that I employ.
See, you, like most people, underestimate it's value. Just give me ten minutes to check the merchants at this port of call. Excitedly. Hopefully, they will have the lotus tile in stock and I can get on with my life. Zuko breathes fire up at the ceiling in anger and Iroh smiles. I'm lucky to have such an understanding nephew.
I've checked all the shops on this pier. Not a lotus tile in the entire marketplace.
Quite the contrary. I always say, the only thing better than finding something you are looking for Crew members begin to walk past carrying Iroh's purchases. is finding something you weren't looking for at a great bargain! A crew member walks past the two playing a tsungi horn.
For music night on the ship. Now, if we only had some woodwinds. Pointing to the ship. Oh, this place looks promising! The monkey statue is shown again. Oh, that is handsome! Wouldn't it look magnificent in the galley?
Yeah, it kind of is. Katara glares at Iroh.
Are you so busy fighting you cannot see your own ship has set sail?
It's no proverb! Points to Team Avatar who has hijacked the pirate ship.
Pondering. Maybe it should be a proverb ...
Chuckles. Prince Zuko, you're really going to get a kick out of this. That lotus tile was in my sleeve the whole time! Has a big smile on his face.
What a stunning view.
You know, the Avatar hasn't been seen for one hundred years. The chances of finding him here are very slim. Cut to a shot of Zuko's bandaged side.
Prince Zuko, it's only been a week since your banishment. You should take some time to heal and rest.
Placing a hand on his shoulder. You know Prince Zuko, destiny is a funny thing. You never know how things are going to work out. But if you keep an open mind, and an open heart, I promise you will find your own destiny someday.
Relaxing in a hot spring. Over here!
You look tired, Prince Zuko. Why don't you join me in these hot springs and soak away your troubles?
You should take your teacher's advice and relax a little. The temperature's just right. I heated it myself. He breathes steam through his nose.
Very well! He gets up, exposing himself.
Who's there? He sees a rat-like animal. A meadow vole! I should have known. He takes the creature into the palm of his hand. You startled me, little one. Sighs. It seems I dozed off and missed my nephew's deadline, but it was a very sweet nap.
Where are you taking me?
Right, but where, specifically?
Ah, the great city of Ba Sing Se.
I acknowledge my defeat at Ba Sing Se. After 600 days away from home, my men were tired, and I was tired. Yawns. And I'm still tired. He falls off one of the horses. He is quickly picked back up. However, he leaves one of his sandals behind and smiles cleverly.
Nothing. Pauses. Actually, there is a bit of a problem. My old joints are sore and aching, and these shackles are too loose.
That's right. The cuffs move and jangle around and bump my wrists. It would help me if you tighten them so they wouldn't shake around so much.
Excellent form, Prince Zuko.
Yeah, that's true, but you are clearly outmatched.
Close-up. Sailing into Fire Nation waters ... Of all the foolish things you've done in your sixteen years, Prince Zuko, this is the most foolish!
Angrily. Have you completely forgotten that the Fire Lord banished you? Fearfully. What if you're caught?
You give him too much credit. My brother is not the understanding type!
Waving a fan at his face. Uh, really Prince Zuko, couldn't you shoot them down with something more fragrant?
Technically you are still in Earth Kingdom waters. Turn back now and they cannot arrest you.
Please Prince Zuko! If the Fire Nation captures you, there is nothing I can do! Do not follow the Avatar.
We're on a collision course!
Because he wants to follow you. He knows you'll lead him to the prize you're both after: the Avatar.
Voice-over. If the city is as magnificent as its wall, Ba Sing Se must be something to behold. I hope you all may see it someday, if we don't burn it to the ground first! Laughs.
