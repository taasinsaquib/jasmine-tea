Appa! Appa! [Closer shot of Aang, who blows his bison whistle.]
Appa! [The camera pans up to the empty desert. Aang's eyes start watering and he closes them.] No. [Opens his eyes with anger.] No! [Slams his glider against the ground, using airbending to send sand up into the air.]
I guess this means we'll always be together. [Laughs as Appa continues licking his face.]
Always.
[Talking in his sleep.] Okay, Roku.
There it is. That's Roku's home.
[He climbs on Fang, who flies off.] Where're we going?
[Surprised.] You were friends with Fire Lord Sozin‌?
You don't have to tell me.
Wait, whose party is it?
[Excited.] Hey, we're almost at the Southern Air Temple!
No way!
He's air surfing! I can't believe I never thought of that.
[Smiling and surprised.] That's amazing! I can't believe you were friends with Monk Gyatso just like I was!
[As Roku lifts the veil.] Roku, it's that girl who didn't even know you're alive!
This is amazing, Roku! You're battling a volcano, and you're winning.
Who's ... wait, that's me, isn't it? [Cut to a long shot of three Air Nomads. A nun holds up the baby to the light while two people, presumably the infant's parents, stand in the shadows.]
Roku? Roku!
[Cut to Aang from the side, with Sokka standing near him.] No, that's wrong. I don't think that was the point of what Roku showed me at all.
[Cut to Katara, Toph and Sokka from the behind, as Aang speaks.] Roku was just as much Fire Nation as Sozin was, right? If anything, their story proves anyone's capable of great good and great evil. [Cut to an aerial shot of the hardened lava wave.] Everyone, even the Fire Lord and the Fire Nation have to be treated like they're worth giving a chance. [Shot cuts to a close-up of Aang's face.] And I also think it was about friendships.
[Catching Toph's hand.] I don't see why not.
[Shocked.] My staff!
Yip yip!
[To a sulking Sokka.] Sorry about your boomerang, Sokka.
[Interested.] Avatar Day?
There's a holiday for the Avatar. Who knew?
Having a huge festival in your honor is great, but frankly, it's just nice to be appreciated.
That's the biggest me I've ever seen!
[Angered.] That party pooper's my friend! [He takes off his hat and throws it away to reveal his arrow.]
No, I'm not, I ...
[Landing beside Katara.] It's true! I'm on your side.
[Utterly shocked.] You think that I ... murdered someone?
[Frightened by the appearances of the old man.] Huh!
Give me a chance to clear my name!
[Confidently.] I'll gladly stand trial!
No problem.
[Apologetically.] How was I supposed to know they wouldn't take Water Tribe money?
I can't.
[Unhappy.] I can't do that with people thinking I'm a murderer either. I need you guys to help prove my innocence.
[Cunningly.] That's okay, Sokka. For some reason, I thought you were an expert detective.
So, you'll help me with my case?
[Hopeful.] You think so?
[Doubtful.] I don't know ...
[Smiling sincerely.] You guys are great.
Then how can I prove my innocence?
[Still tied up, unsure.] Right ... evidence. [He shifts his eyes to the left while he is trying to remember what to say. Enthusiastically.] Ladies and gentlemen ... I'm about to tell you what really happened. And I will prove it with facts. Fact number one. [Raises his finger to count along but blanks out.] Uhhh ...
Oh, yeah. You see ... I have very large feet. [The camera tilts down to reveal his small feet. The villagers are unimpressed by his argument.] Furthermore ... your temple matches your statue. [The villagers look from one to the other, not knowing where Aang is going with this.] But ... I was in a painting at sunset. [He quickly ends his exposition with a big smile.] So, there you have it, I'm not guilty.
[Higher pitch.] Hey, everybody! Avatar Kyoshi here. [Rapidly blinks his eyes.]
[Confused.] So, what just happened?
I said I would face justice, so I will.
[Apathetically.] Gee, I'd love to help, but I'm supposed to be boiled in oil.
[Sheepishly, as Katara glares at Sokka.] Yeah. We were on the ship and there was this booby trap, and, well -- [Awkwardly rubs his head.] -- we booby-ed right into it.
[Sorrowfully.] Don't blame Katara. I brought her there. It's my fault.
[Optimistically.] You should try it sometime.
[Confusedly.] I am? [Brightening.] Great!
[Understanding.] Katara, I don't want to come between you and your family.
Thanks for penguin sledding with me.
Guess I'll go back home and look for the airbenders. [He places one hand on Appa, but is suddenly struck with realization.] Wow, I haven't cleaned my room in a hundred years. Not looking forward to that. [He uses his airbending to hop onto Appa's head.] It was nice meeting everyone.
[Encouragingly.] Come on Appa, you can do it. Yip-yip!
[Sadly.] I'll miss you, too. [Looks at Katara, who frowns back at him, her eyes saddened while her hair loopies sway in the wind.] Come on, boy.
[Sorrowfully.] Yeah, I liked her too. [Catches sight of Fire Nation ship advancing toward the Southern Water Tribe; gasps.] The village! [He slides off the ice formation onto the ground.] Appa, wait here.
[Cheerfully, despite the present situation.] Hey, Katara. Hey, Sokka.
Looking for me?
[Calmly, tilting his head to one side with a somewhat confused expression.] Well, you're just a teenager.
If I go with you, [He holds his staff in front of him as an offer, making sure Zuko understands that he does not wish to continue fighting.] will you promise to leave everyone alone?
[Surprisingly calm.] Don't worry, Katara. It'll be okay. [He gasps when he is shoved on the walkway. Katara's face contorts with sadness and fright.] Take care of Appa for me until I get back.
[Slyly.] So, I guess you've never fought an airbender before. I bet I could take you both with my hands tied behind my back.
You haven't seen my staff around, have you?
[Off camera.] Thanks anyway!
[Whispering.] Sorry!
My staff!
[Ecstatic.] Appa!
[Weakly.] Hey, Katara. Hey, Sokka. Thanks for coming.
[Weakly.] I dropped my staff.
[Quietly, slightly downcast, sitting on the edge of the saddle.] I don't know. I just sort of ... did it.
Because ... [Turns away slightly; saddened.] I never wanted to be.
[Downcast.] And how am I going to do that?
[Looking at Katara.] That's what the monks told me.
[Turning to face her, smiling and brightening up completely.] We can learn it together!
[Cheerfully, pulling out a rolled up scroll.] All right, but before I learn waterbending, we have some serious business to attend to. [He uses airbending to situate himself onto the saddle and unrolls the scroll, revealing a map of the Avatar World.] Here, here and here.
[Points to the location in Earth Kingdom.] Here, we'll ride the hopping llamas. [Points to the location in Air Nomad territory.] Then waaay over here, we'll surf on the backs of giant koi fish. [Katara and Sokka stare at him in wonder.] Then back over here, we'll ride the hog monkeys. [The siblings glance at each other.] They don't like people riding them, but that's what makes it fun!
Nah, just a nightmare. I was in the Avatar State, but I was outside my body watching myself. It was scary. I was scary. [Closes eyes and bows his head; Katara puts her hand on his shoulder.]
Appa, yip yip!
[Casually.] I try not to think about it too much.
[Shocked.] What? No I'm not!
See, it's this special state where-
[Doubtfully.] Right, but, I don't know how to get in or out of the Avatar State, much less what to do once I'm there.
General Fong?
I'm in. I'll fight the Fire Lord.
[Sits on his bed.] I told the general I'd help him, by going into the Avatar State.
Katara, I'm just being realistic! I don't have time to do this the right way!
Ten-fold energy, huh?
[Quickly in a high-pitched voice.] Is it working? Is it working? I can't tell! Somebody tell me if I'm in the Avatar State 'cause I don't have a good view of myself! Am I talking too loud?
I love surprises!
[Holding up hands.] Still not glowing.
[Annoyed.] This is just mud!
Sure.
I'm really glad you told me that. But I still need to do this.
[Cuts to overall view of Aang and Katara.] No, you don't. Every day, more and more people die. I'm already one hundred years late. Defeating the Fire Lord is the only way to stop this war. I have to try it!
[Sadly.] Good night.
[Sits up in his bed.] Sokka! Sokka, wake up.
I don't think we should be trying to bring on the Avatar State.
Yes.
Do you think the general will be mad?
[Humbly.] The thing is, I don't think we'll ever be able to trigger it on purpose. So I guess that's it.
I'm sure. I can only reach the Avatar State when I'm in genuine danger.
[Alarmed.] What are you doing?
[Looking about cautiously.] I'm not your enemy! I won't fight you!
You can't fight forever!
[Worried; clenches his fists.] Don't hurt her!
[Desperately and clutching onto Fong's arm.] Stop this! You have to let her go!
[Tears forming around his eyes.] I'm trying ... I'm trying!
[Falling to his knees, begging.] You don't need to do this!
What do you mean?
[Embracing her; regretfully.] I'm sorry, Katara. I hope you never have to see me like that again.
[Slightly angry.] You're out of your mind.
What happened? [Sees the Fire Nation designs and flag and immediately assumes he has been captured.] Oh no!
[Confused.] Momo?
Are you sure? [Rubs eyes.] I feel like I'm dreaming.
Sokka? [Breathes heavily, appears to be passing out.]
Why are we on a Fire Nation ship? Why is everyone dressed this way? And why am I the only one who's completely out of it? [Katara and Aang are left alone.]
I have hair? [Feels it.] How long was I out?
[Removing Katara's hand he shakes Hakoda's hand.] Nice to officially meet you, Chief Hakoda.
Are you mad at your dad or something? [Katara looks at Hakoda leave with an expression of annoyance on her face.]
Mmm, a little higher. Uhhh!
Wow, you're definitely in the right area there.
I went down! I didn't just get hurt, did I? It was worse than that. I was gone! But you brought me back.
[Turning to look at her.] You saved me.
So what now?
Me?
The world thinks I'm dead? How is that good news? That's terrible!
No, no, no, no, no. You have no idea. This is so messed up!
I'll handle this. The Avatar is back. [Opens glider and grunts in pain.]
I hate not being able to do anything.
I just can't stand by and do nothing! [Runs out.]
Fine. [Grabs his staff and walks away.]
[Clutching his stomach.] Well, I am pretty hungry. Maybe dinner's a good idea.
I'm not going out if I can't wear my arrow proudly! [He lies back down.]
You're right, I don't. But the problem is, I did fail!
[Getting up.] It is true. I was in Ba Sing Se. I was there! But I lost. And now the Earth Kingdom is fallen for good.
And I hate the invasion plan, too! [Rips down the Fire Nation flag covering his staff.] I don't want you or anyone else risking your lives to fix my mistakes! I've always known that I would have to face the Fire Lord. But now I know I need to do it alone.
Katara, please! Just go ... please.
I need to redeem myself. I need my honor back.
A blockade.
I'm not gonna make it. I failed. [Within the lightning strikes, the spirit of Roku appears before Aang.] Roku?
But everyone thinks I'm dead again. They think I've abandoned them, and I'm losing this war. I'm letting the whole world down.
I don't know.
[Determined.] You're right. I won't give up.
I have so much to do.
What about the invasion?
It's okay. If someone saw it, it would give away my identity. It's better for now that no one knows I'm alive.
Hey, look! [Examines the sword.] A sword made out of a whale's tooth.
[Rummaging through the bushes; somewhat cheerfully.] No, we found something!
[Intrigued.] So, then what happened?
[Having awoken, along with Katara.] Who the what now?
[Bows in greeting.] Hi, I'm Aang.
Thank you, it's truly an honor to be here. If there's anything- [Sokka abruptly cuts him off.]
[Sarcastically.] Yeah, nothing's cozier than dead animal skins.
[Sokka and Katara are slurping their stewed sea prunes as Aang speaks.] Hey, I ride animals, too! There was this one time when I rode a giant eel and I-
[Curiously.] What's that story?
I can't believe they would leave me.
Uhhh, I know Bato!
It's the map to Sokka and Katara's dad!
Hey everyone! Sorry I was gone so long.
Yup, but now I'm back. [Sitting down.] Sure could go for some delicious sea prunes!
[Takes back the crumpled paper.] I'm sorry, I'll take care of this. [Bows. As Mother Superior walks away, Aang stuffs the map back up his sleeve.]
What's ice dodging?
[Blinks. Defensively.] I know that. Why wouldn't I know that? [Folds his arms.] I'm the Avatar; I know about trust. [He crosses his arms and looks away, but gives Bato a second glance.]
What does that even mean?
I can't. [Looks down.]
[Rubbing off his mark and backing away.] No, you can't trust me.
[Takes the crumpled map out of his sleeve.] A messenger gave this to me for Bato. [Katara takes it from him.] You have to understand. I was afraid you would-
Okay. You too.
Guess I should be moving on.
I'm an idiot, Momo. [Momo chitters.]
Looks like we're going alone, guys.
[Annoyed.] Okay, I get it. Everybody wants me gone.
Who?
Zuko.
A necklace? [Gasps.] Katara!
You've got something I want.
So ... where do we go?
[Turns to the group.] Don't you want to see your father?
I wish I could give you a little piece of home, Katara. Something to remind you ...
Still, just a little trinket. Maybe something like ... [Holds up Katara's necklace.] this? [Closer shot of the necklace.]
Zuko asked me to be sure I got it to you.
Sure.
When was the last time you saw your dad?
[The camera cuts to a frontal of Aang.] Sorry. [He looks down in guilt.] I didn't mean to bring that up.
[Frontal view as he swims along in the water. Defensively, but innocently.] What? I'm wearing trunks.
[While sliding down the tunnel.] Whoa! [The guard turns his head and hides. Cut to a wide-view of the area as the two guards hide and one of them looks throw his telescope. Cut to a view through the telescope as Aang emerges from the water, with Momo.] Let's go again! [Momo chitters in response as Aang jumps out of the water. The camera pans as the telescope follows Aang's movements up the cliff. Cut to frontal view of the guards watching and shaking in horror. Cut to side-view from the other side of the rock.]
[Gets up.] We can't! Jump on Appa! I'll try to distract him!
I'm okay. [Momo jumps on his shoulder.]
What's that supposed to be, Sokka?
Ow, my arrow!
[Cut to Aang and Sokka, with the latter listening to Toph's statement with his ears, which have grown big.] Even if it was, nothing beats air!
[Cut to an aerial shot of Aang, Katara and Toph standing on the ground with Sokka flying above.] I'm showing these two why air is the best element!
[Pointing above.] Come on, heh!
Today's the day! [Lands near a sleeping Sokka.] Can you believe it? After all that time searching for a teacher, I'm finally starting earthbending! [Momo chitters and lands on Sokka.] And this place, [Momo moves on to Appa's head.] it's perfect, don't you think? Sokka? [Sokka grumbles and glares at Aang with tired eyes.] Oh, you're still sleeping, huh? [Sokka again grumbles and puts his head back down. Aang whispers.] Sorry.
Good morning, Sifu Toph.
[Scratches the back of his head.] Well, if you think I should ...
[Excitedly.] So what move are you going to teach me first? [Stretches out his right arm, his fist clenched, and brings it down like a hammer.] Rock-a-lanche? [He brings his left clenched fist to his right elbow, while his right arm is bent upward, the fist also clenched. He trembles with the motion.] The Trembler? Oh, maybe I could learn to make a [Stretches both arms over his head and starts to spin around.] whirlpool out of land!
[Claps excitedly.] Sounds good, sounds good!
Like a rock. Got it.
I'm ready. [Tries to move it, but instead he is forced backward into Appa.]
Maybe there's another way ... what if I came at the boulder from another angle?
Whoa!
[Sarcastically.] Yeah, thanks, Katara!
I guess I just panicked. I don't know what to say.
[Disappointed.] I know. I'm sorry.
No, I don't think I do.
Yeah, that sounds good.
I don't want to talk about it.
[Frustrated at himself.] I know, I know, I know, I know! I get it, all right? I need to face it head on like a rock, but I just can't do it. I don't know why I can't, but I can't.
I guess it's earth.
Thanks, Katara. Sifu Katara. [Bows.]
As a matter of fact, I don't mind. I'm happy to share anything I have.
Actually, I prefer if you didn't ... [Crack.] That's an antique, handcrafted by the monks ... [Crack.] It's a delicate instrument!
[Resumes meditating.] Ohm.
[Frustrated.] Meditating here!
We'll find him faster if we split up. [The two begin to search.]
Sokka! Are you okay? [Tries to pull him out.]
Hmmm ... I bet I can airbend you out of here. [Blows up a gust of wind but Sokka remains trapped.]
I can't ... I can't do it.
I can't do that either.
It would just be really ... uncomfortable.
Thanks, Sokka. This whole earthbending thing really has me confused. There's so much pressure. Everyone expects me to get it right away. It puts me in a really awkward position.
If I try, I fail. If I don't try, I'm never going to get it. I feel like I'm caught between a rock and a hard place.
Awww, what a cute name for a baby saber-tooth moose-lion cub.
It's hard to tell before their giant teeth and horns grow in. What are you doing out here little guy? Did you lose your mama?
Hey there, we found your cub! See, we have no problem with you! We're friendly!
Oh no! [Gets on top of a rock to try and distract the saber-tooth moose-lion.] Woo-hoo, look at me!
I won't.
What? You were there the whole time?
Why didn't you do something? Sokka was in trouble! I was in trouble! You could have gotten him out and helped us get away!
[Grabs hold of it.] Enough! I want my staff back! [Takes it away.]
What?
But–
I can't believe it!
No problem, Sokka!
[Interrupting Sokka.] Hey Katara, look what I can do! [Bends a rock and slams it on the ground.]
Appa, Appa, I can earthbend now! The key is being completely rooted. Physically and mentally unmovable!
Look! There's a coupon on the back! The first lesson is free.
Ehhh, he's not the one. [Beats his right ear, causing sand to fall out of his left ear.]
Excuse me, but where is this earthbending tournament, exactly?
[Looks surprised.] How'd you get them to tell you?
Hey, front row seats! I wonder why no one else is sitting here.
[Shrugs.] I don't know. Bumi said I need a teacher who listens to the earth. He's just listening to his big muscles. What do you think, Sokka?
[Frontal shot.] I think she is.
She waited ... and listened.
I will!
[Aang puts his hands up in a conciliatory gesture.] I don't really want to fight you. I want to talk to you.
Please, wait!
[Going after her.] Please, listen! I need an earthbending teacher, and I think it's supposed to be you!
Wait!
If we want to find the Blind Bandit, the Earthbending Academy is a great place to start.
We need to talk to her. Do you guys know where she lives?
That's because we're asking about the wrong person. In my vision, I saw a girl, in a white dress, with a pet flying boar. Know anybody like that?
A flying boar is good enough for me. Let's check it out.
That's the flying boar from my vision. Come on!
How did you know it was me?
Well, a crazy king told me I had to find an earthbender who listens to the earth. And then I had a vision in a magic swamp, [Toph raises her eye in disbelief.] and -
Allow me. [Sends a small tornado at the cup. Everyone claps.]
I'd like to defeat the Fire Lord by the end of summer, but I can't do that without finding an earthbending teacher first. [Close-up of Toph with a annoyed look.]
Then she must be a great earthbender! Probably good enough to teach someone else! [Toph sends a fissure under the table at him.] Ow!
Oh, I'm sure she's better than you think she is.
[Just as angrily.] What's your problem?
Good night, buddy.
[Looks around.] That's amazing.
Is that why you became the Blind Bandit?
Then why stay here where you're not happy?
You could come with us.
Go, I'll be okay.
Hit it harder!
I'm sorry, Toph.
[Cut to a wider shot from behind them. The full moon shines in the distance.] Not like her.
Toph! What are you doing here?
You're going to be a great teacher, Toph.
Okay.
How's Sokka doing?
I couldn't find any ginger root for the tea. But I found a map. There's an herbalist institute on top of that mountain. We could probably find a cure for Sokka there.
Not you too!
[Shielding his face.] That's how Sokka started yesterday. Now look at him! He thinks he's an earthbender!
A few more hours and you'll be talking nonsense, too. I'm going to go find some medicine! [He grabs his glider and begins to head out just as a flash of lightning strikes.] Uh, maybe it's safer if I go on foot. [To Appa and Momo.] Keep an eye on them guys. [Appa groans while Momo chitters.]
[Speaking fast.] Hello, I'm sorry to barge in like this, but I need some medicine for my friends, they have fevers and they were coughing- [Gets cut off by the herbalist.]
That's nice.
That's nice. Are you almost done?
[He lifts up his head off the table.] Finally! [Close-up of the mixing bowl as the herbalist drops the flower into the mixture, and Aang grabs for the bowl.] Thanks for all your help!
Ow!
[Rubs his hand, flinching.] Taking the cure to my friends.
What about my friends?
[Confused.] What am I supposed to do with frozen frogs?
[Shocked and disgusted; his eye twitches.] Suck on them?
You're insane, aren't you?
Uh ... I think you dropped this ... [Screams as he sees the Yuyan Archers taking aim at him. Panicking, he frees himself from the arrow that had pinned his foot to the ground and runs. He falls off a cliff into a swamp and finds the frozen frogs.] A frog!
[Angry.] I've never hidden from you! Untie me and I'll fight you right now!
[To the frogs.] What? No! Don't leave, frogs! My friends are sick and they need you! Please go back to being frozen!
Who are you? What's going on? Are you here to rescue me? [The Blue Spirit opens the door and motions for him to follow.] I'll take that as a "yes."
My frogs! Come back! And stop thawing out! [The Blue Spirit comes back, picks him up by the collar and carries him out.] Wait! My friends need to suck on those frogs!
Stay close to me!
Take this. Jump on my back!
Give me the next one!
[To Zuko.] You know what the worst part of being born over a hundred years ago is? I miss all the friends I used to hang out with. Before the war started, I used to always visit my friend Kuzon. The two of us, we'd get in and out of so much trouble together. He was one of the best friends I ever had, and he was from the Fire Nation, just like you. If we knew each other back then, do you think we could have been friends, too?
Suck on these. They'll make you feel better.
No, I don't think I did.
I like jokes.
[Sighs.] Nobody else has homework. [Stands up and walks to a spot and starts hot squatting while Katara and Toph walk away.] One hot squat, two hot squat, three hot squat, four hot squat ...
Sounds like a crazy fishing trip.
[In a weak voice.] I need to ask you something ...
Please ... come closer.
[In a clear, happy, hopeful tone.] Will you go penguin sledding with me?
[Looking around and rubbing his head, while Katara scrambles on her feet.] What's going on here?
[Lazily pushes the spear away.] I'm not sure.
[Exclaims happily.] Appa! Are you all right? [He hangs down the side of the beast to look at its eyes, which are still closed.] Wake up, buddy.
[Laughing cheerfully.] Ha, ha! You're okay!
This is Appa, my flying bison.
[Cheerfully.] Don't worry, it'll wash out. [Green snot is hanging from Sokka's face to his glove, dripping down as he retracts his hand. Katara covers her mouth in disgust.] So do you guys live around here?
I'm A ... a-a-a-Achoo! [The boy sneezes, creating an air blast that sends him soaring into the air. He lands on the ground, unharmed.] I'm Aang. [He sniffles a bit.]
[He looks questioningly toward the sky.] Really? It felt higher than that.
Sure am!
Well, if you guys are stuck, Appa and I can give you a lift. [Aang airbends himself onto Appa.]
Okay, first time flyers, hold on tight! Appa, yip-yip!
Come on, Appa. Yip-yip!
[Katara shoots her brother an angry glance.] Appa's just a little tired. A little rest and he'll be soaring through the sky. You'll see. [Katara smiles at Aang, who returns this gesture. When she wants to move back, she realizes that he is still smiling at her.]
Oh, I was smiling? [Flattered, Katara smiles back.]
Hey. What'cha thinkin' about?
Oh, no. I didn't know him. I mean, I knew people that knew him, but I didn't. Sorry. [He smiles weakly at Katara.]
Sleep tight.
[Uncomfortably.] Uh, why are they all looking at me like that? Did Appa sneeze on me?
[Shocked disbelief.] Extinct?
[Aang uses a small air current to get his staff back.] It's not for stabbing! It's for airbending. [He opens his staff into a glider, making Sokka gasp in fright and cover his head with his hands.]
Not magic, airbending. [He moves his glider around him, visually demonstrating what he is talking about.] It lets me control the air currents around my glider and fly.
[Accepting Sokka's challenge, smiling.] Check again!
[Surprised and with admiration.] You're a waterbender?
[Muffled.] See? Now my tongue is stuck to my staff!
[Amused.] Wow! Everything freezes in there!
[Slides down from Appa's head.] What war? What are you talking about?
[Exclaims enthusiastically.] Penguin!
[Chasing the penguins while laughing.] Hey, come on little guy. Wanna go sledding? [He jumps at a penguin, but the animal evades his attempt and Aang belly flops into the snow. He turns on his back and quickly erects himself with his airbending as Katara comes up beside him.] Heh heh. I have a way with animals.
[Having grabbed the tail of a penguin, he holds on as it pulls him through the snow for a short way before letting go and looking up at Katara.] You got a deal! Just one little problem ... [He airbends himself into a sitting position.] I'm an airbender, not a waterbender. Isn't there someone in your tribe who can teach you?
This isn't right. A waterbender needs to master water. [He thinks for a moment.] What about the North Pole? There's another Water Tribe up there, right? Maybe they have waterbenders who could teach you.
But you forget, I have a flying bison. [He happily points at himself.] Appa and I can personally fly you to the North Pole. Katara, we're going to find you a master!
Well, you think about it, but in the meantime, can you teach me catch one of these penguins?
Hi hi hi! Ha, ha, ha!
You still are a kid!
[In awe.] Whoa! What is that?
If you want to be a bender, you have to let go of fear.
Okay, back up. I have friends all over the world, even in the Fire Nation. [Aang picks up a Guan Dao to inspect it.] I've never seen any war.
[Uncertain.] I don't know. A few days, maybe?
[In full disbelief and slightly accusing.] What?! That's impossible! Do I look like a hundred-twelve-year-old man to you?
A hundred years! [Saddened by his new discovery.] I can't believe it.
[Cheerfully.] I did get to meet you.
Huh?
What's that you said about booby traps?
Uh oh ... [Aang notices a hole in the roof of the ship and takes a surprised Katara into his arms.] Hold on tight!
So you were showing me the octopus form?
[Blushing.] Oh, yea ... thanks.
Just ... people.
[Starts out with a somewhat puzzled tone, but changes it to an excited one.] You guys are nomads? That's great! I'm a nomad!
[Blankly.] I know ... you just said that.
[Wearing a wreath of pink flowers on his head.] Hey, Sokka, you should hear some of these stories. These guys have been everywhere!
They said they'll take us to see a giant night crawler!
Yeah, thanks for the help, but Appa hates going underground. [Flashing a smile.] And we need to do whatever makes Appa most comfortable ...
[Making sure he understands.] So all you need to do is trust in love to get through these caves?
[Smiling.] We can make it.
Yeah, but I wouldn't mind a map also.
[Running up to a solid rock door.] We found the exit!
[Walking to her side.] No. It's a tomb.
It must be the two lovers from the legend; that's who's buried here.
How are we going to find our way out of these tunnels?
[Curiously.] What?
Katara, what is it?
Right ...
[Utterly confused and lost.] Where are you going with this?
[Very surprised.] Us ... kissing‌?
[Dreamily.] Us ... kissing ...
[Fake-jokingly.] Yeah. [Awkwardly laughs.] I definitely wouldn't want to kiss you! [Beat.]
[Realizing his mistake.] No, no, I mean ... if there was a choice between kissing you and dying ...
[Desperately.] What? I'm saying is I would rather kiss you than die - that's a compliment.
[Miserably.] What is wrong with me ...
We're going to run out of light any second now, aren't we?
Then, what are we going to do?
They're made of some kind of crystal. They must only light up in the dark.
So, uh ...
What about Sokka?
Just like the legend said, we let love lead the way. [Smiles sheepishly.]
So are you guys going to come to Omashu with us?
Okay. Thanks for everything, Moku.
[Cheerfully.] That's not gross, it's just a part of spring! You know, rebirth, flowers blooming and Appa gets a new coat.
[Wearing a beard of fur.] And a great beard! [Aang and Sokka laugh while pointing at each other.]
[Landing onto the ground to aid Sokka.] Sorry!
What is it?
Better safe than sorry.
Should we do something?
[Approaching Katara.] Okay, okay, you both need to calm down.
[Awkwardly.] I ... can see that. [Backs off.]
[Notices the smoke.] I don't think so, Sokka.
[Resting against the saddle; Sokka is seen lying on his back, sleeping.] I don't know. But this time, I'm going to make sure we lose it.
Come on guys, there's something after us and we don't even know what [Pulls top part of his shirt over his head; says in a muffled voice.] or who it is.
That's impossible. There's no way they could have tracked us.
[Calmly.] Maybe we should face them. Find out who they are. Who knows, maybe they're friendly.
Appa, yip yip!
[Calmly.] Sokka, we'll be okay.
We can't keep flying forever.
[Yawns.] So what's our plan?
Appa fell asleep!
[Urgently.] Wake up, buddy!
Appa's exhausted.
[Trying to calm the tension.] All right, all right, everyone's exhausted! Let's just get some rest.
[Desperately.] No! No, she's not blaming you.
[Sitting on Appa's tail.] What? You're blaming Appa?
[Jumps down to face her.] How dare you blame Appa! He saved your life three times today! If there's anyone to blame it's you! You're always talking about how you carry your own weight, but you're not. He is! Appa's carrying your weight. He never had a problem flying when it was just the three of us!
What did I just do? [Slumps.] I can't believe I yelled at my earthbending teacher. Now she's gone.
[Grabs a handful of fur and watches as it blows away in the wind.] I have a plan.
Toph was right. The fur was leaving a trail right to us. But now that he's clean, no more trail.
He'll be fine as long as we leave his saddle and all our stuff here. [Kneels down and places pieces of Appa's fur into his satchel.] I'm going to use Appa's fur to make a fake trail to lead the tank off-course.
All right, you've caught up with me. Now, who are you and what do you want?
So what now?
[Rises to face her.] I'm not running.
[Alarmed.] Zuko!
[Covers mouth to suppress laughter.] "Zuzu"?
[Thrilled.] Katara!
[Doubtfully.] It's such a big city.
I'm comin' for ya, buddy. [Katara walks over to the downtrodden Aang, and places her hand on his shoulder. More confidently.] He's here; I can feel it.
[Upset and somewhat bored.] This is why I never came here before. I always heard it was so different from the way the monks taught us to live. [Looks out the window.]
[Close-up view. Bored and annoyed.] Can we see the king now?
[Cut to Momo and Aang. Aang turns to look out the window determined.] If we're going to be here for a month, we should spend our time looking for Appa. [At the sound of Appa's name, Momo wakes up.]
[Cut to shot of Aang and Sokka, Joo Dee lurking behind.] If someone wanted to sell a stolen animal without anyone knowing, where would they go‌?
[Side-view of gang. Smiles.] Nice to meet you, Pong.
You mean, platypus bear?
[Frontal view.] Gopher bear?
Yeah, I'm mastering every element. How hard could manners be‌?
Good evening, Mr. Sokka Water Tribe, Ms. Katara Water Tribe, Lord Momo of the Momo Dynasty. Your Momo-ness. [Frontal view of Momo as he peeks at Aang from under the carpet and slightly bows.]
[Closing his hands into a fist.] Earth!
[Stunned.] Wow, you look beautiful.
[Worried and nervous.] Where are they?
Or we could go in as these guys. Toph said we might pass as busboys!
[A little worried.] Where are Toph and Katara?
[Slightly nervous.] I don't know what he looks like.
That could be anyone!
[Surprised and happy.] You found us!
Sorry. No, don't shout.
[View of Aang from above.] Watch this, everybody!
Greetings, Your Majesty.
This could be the most important thing he's ever heard.
[Stepping forward, pointing a finger at Long Feng.] I'll tell them! I'll make sure everyone knows!
I don't know. In my vision, I just knew she needed help.
Uh ...
I'm great! It went great with the guru. I completely mastered the Avatar State. [He laughs nervously and looks down.] Yeah.
But, in my vision, I felt so sure she was in trouble.
Okay. Maybe you're right.
Momo!
Katara is in trouble! I knew it!
You guys know each other?
She must have Katara.
Then we'll work together to fight Azula, and save Katara and Zuko.
Katara's in trouble. All of Ba Sing Se is in trouble. Working together is our best chance.
So, Toph thinks you give pretty good advice, and great tea!
Well, I met with this guru who was supposed to help me master the Avatar State and control this great power, but to do it, I had to let go of someone I love. [He and Iroh stop.] And I just couldn't.
[Earthbends again.] What happens if we can't save anyone and beat Azula? Without the Avatar State, what if I'm not powerful enough?
Saving you, that's what.
There's too many. [He looks at Katara.]
I'm sorry, Katara.
[Momo jumps onto his shoulder; cheerfully.] Top of the morning, Momo!
[Moves his hand aside in a sweeping motion.] Like a baby moose lion. [Assumes a fighting stance and raises fists; exuberantly.] I'm ready to face the Fire Lord.
[Looks down sorrowfully.] I can't. [Cut to side-view of him, the camera panning slightly to the left.] When Azula shot me with lightning, [Close his eyes briefly.] my seventh chakra was locked, cutting off my connection to all the cosmic energy in the universe. [Cut back to shot of him and Toph.]
[Appears on screen with Toph.] Toph, this is Haru. When we met him, his town was controlled by the Fire Nation. So he had to hide his earthbending.
A new glider! This is amazing!
Oh ... well, I'm sure that will come in handy.
We've been looking everywhere for you. The boats are ready to leave.
What?
[Approaches, putting a hand on his shoulder.] Sokka, that speech wasn't your moment of truth. That was just public speaking, and nobody's really good at that.
Look, your moment of truth isn't gonna be in front of some map; it's gonna be out there on the battlefield.
Because I already failed the world once at Ba Sing Se. I won't let myself fail again.
[To Toph, Sokka, and Katara, who approach him.] So, this is it huh?
I'm ready. [Sokka and Aang shake hands and the group hugs.]
[Turning to see Katara.] Katara, I ...
You go first.
Everything's gonna be different after today, isn't it.
What if ... what if I don't come back?
What do you know? It did come in handy.
[Looking around.] That's strange. [He continues onto the Royal Palace, breaks open the door, and takes a fighting stance.] The Avatar is back! [Realizing no one is around he relaxes, looking confused.] Hello? Anyone home?
No. [Kneels down on the ground; frustrated.] No, no, no! Fire Lord Ozai, where are you!?
[Katara and Aang kneel with Sokka.] He wasn't home. No one was. The entire palace city is abandoned.
[Dismayed.] It's over. The Fire Lord is probably long-gone; far away on some remote island where he'll be safe during the eclipse.
We can still do this. We can still win the day.
[Rising, turning his back to the group, determined.] I've gotta try.
Do you feel anything down there?
[To Appa and Momo.] Stay safe. We'll be back soon.
How is that careful?
[Spinning his staff open.] Climb aboard and hold on tight.
[Suspicious look suddenly becomes friendly.] Thanks!
I'm ready. I'm ready to face the Fire Lord.
Where is he? Where's the Fire Lord?
[While running.] I can't pin her down! She's too quick!
Okay, so what do we do, just ignore her?
[Grabs Sokka's shoulder as camera pans slightly to the right.] Sokka, she won't talk.
Maybe it's not too late. The eclipse is over. But I can face the Fire Lord anyway.
But I'm ready! I came here with a job to do and everyone's counting on me.
[Disappointed.] I guess you guys are right.
They've got air power, but so do I! [Cut to Aang as he opens his glider.] I'm gonna do what I can to slow them down. [He tosses his glider into the air and takes off, Momo following close behind.]
Let's join the others! [Dodges another fireball.]
[Thoughtfully.] They're heading for the beach ... [Alarmed.] They're gonna destroy the submarines!
Thank you all for being so brave and so strong. I'm gonna make this up to you.
[Looking at the airship in the distance then looks ahead.] I know just the place for us to go where we'll be safe for a while. The Western Air Temple!
[Enraged.] How could you let them take Appa?! ‌ Why didn't you stop them‌?!
[Still enraged.] You could've come to get us. I could've saved him!
[Snaps at Toph in a harsh way.] You just didn't care! You never liked Appa! You wanted him gone!
That's all any of you guys care about, yourselves! You don't care whether Appa is okay or not!
[In a cold, hard tone.] I'm going after Appa.
Appa! [He glides down and lands on a dune.] Appa!
No ... [Yelling.] No!
[Hopelessly.] What's the difference? We won't survive without Appa. We all know it.
[Sadly.] It doesn't matter. None of those will tell us where Appa is.
I'm awake. I couldn't sleep.
[Joyfully.] Appa!
[Lashes out.] I'm sorry, okay! It's a desert cloud; I did all I could! What's anyone else doing?! [Pointing his staff at Katara.] What are you doing‌?!
[Darkly.] Maybe we can find some sandbenders.
Yeah ... look at the shape.
Momo! I'm not losing anyone else out here.
[Angry.] You stole Appa! Where is he? ‌What did you do to him?
[Enraged.] Where is my bison‌?
You tell me where he is now!
[Enraged.] You muzzled Appa‌?
[With the voices of all the Avatars.] Tell me where Appa is!
I bet we'll find something to eat here, [Pointing at the poster.] the Fire Day's Festival. [Momo jumps down. Aang begins reading-out the poster.] Fire Nation cultural exhibits, jugglers, benders, magicians ... [Turns to Katara.] This would be a great place for me to study some real firebenders.
[Comes over to at the poster.] Hey, a poster of me!
[Looking at Katara.] I have to learn firebending at some point and this could be my only chance to watch a master's up close.
[To Appa and Momo.] You guys stay out of sight here while we go to the festival. [To Katara and Sokka.] Ready disguises!
Let's go.
Hey, there's some food.
Hey, look at this.
I don't know, but there's a big crowd so it must be good.
I gotta learn that trick!
[Waving his hand up in the air all around childishly.] Oh! Oh! Me! Me!
I want to get a closer look.
[In a jealous tone while folding his arms.] Awww! That could've been me.
We gotta help her!
I'm calling Appa. [Aang blows his whistle.]
Appa! Down here!
Nice touch setting off the fireworks.
You mean there's a firebender out here who's not with the Fire Lord? [Gets up in excitement.] We've gotta go see him! He can train me!
Sokka, this could be my only chance to meet a firebending master who would actually be willing to teach me.
Is that where Jeong Jeong is? I need to talk to him right away.
What happened? Can I see Jeong Jeong now?
Why won't he see me?
[Shocked.] Wait, how does he know that?
I'm going in, anyway!
Master, I need to learn firebending.
[To Jeong Jeong.] I'm the Avatar, it's my destiny to— [Gets interrupted.]
Okay, but it's the Avatar's duty to master all of the bending disciplines.
Please, I have to learn. This could be my only chance.
Really? That's great! [Raises his hands happily; Jeong Jeong groans in dismay fearing this may not end well.]
Wait! What do I do now?
But what am I concentrating on?
So when do I get to make some fire?
Are we coming up here so I don't burn anything with my fire blasts?
What?
You brought me up here to breathe?
You're not even look— [Interrupted by Jeong Jeong.]
I've been breathing for hours!
I want you to stop wasting my time! I already know how to squat and breathe and feel the sun! [Wiggles fingers to the ceiling to gesture this.] I wanna know how to shoot fire out of my fingertips!
I thought about what you said, I promise I'll be more patient.
Oh yeah! [Aang gets excited and airbends himself into the air. He quickly gets serious again.] I mean, let us begin.
What's going on?
[Annoyed.] This is the worst firebending instruction ever! All he does is leave me for hours to concentrate or breathe!
But I'm ready to do so much more.
[Excited.] I did it! I made fire!
Now that's some firebending!
I wonder how that juggler did it.
Katara! I'm so sorry!
It was an accident! I was, uh... Katara, I'm so--
I'm sorry, I didn't ... [Sokka runs off.] I'm sorry! [Jeong Jeong looks at Aang, displeased.]
Jeong Jeong tried to tell me that I wasn't ready. I wouldn't listen. I'm never going to firebend again.
No, never again.
[Surprised.] What? How?
[Gets on his feet.] Where?
I have to help him!
Jeong Jeong!
[Shocked.] You were Jeong Jeong's student?!
Whoa! Wild shot!
No self-control ... [Gets an idea.]
[Mockingly.] Oh, were we fighting? I thought you were just getting warmed up!
Is that all you got? Man, they'll make anyone an admiral these days! [Nearly gets blasted.] [Aang cups his hands over his to sound louder.] Ahoy! [Moons Zhao with pants up.] I'm Admiral Zhao! [Zhao gets even angrier and Aang nearly gets blasted again.] I don't know why, but I thought you'd be better than Zuko. [Aang looks disappointed when he says this. His eyes go wide and he lies down on the deck fast enough to avoid being burnt. Mocking Zhao's firebending.] Sloppy. Very sloppy.
[Having dodged a series of blasts from Zhao on several ships.] You've lost this battle.
No, but you have. [He gestures around, all the boats are on fire and sinking.] Jeong Jeong said you had no restraint. [Jumps in the water.] Have a nice walk home!
Wait! Where's Jeong Jeong?
Wow, that's good water.
[Shocked.] Two?
I was, but something stopped me. Something big.
[Camera zooms out to drill.] That.
I'm the Avatar. Take me to whoever is in charge.
Not needed?
The question is, how are we going to stop that thing? [All turn their heads to Sokka.]
You're the idea guy.
[Looking out over the wall with a determined look.] We'll take it down from the inside.
Where are we going to get something like that? [Sokka unexpectedly cuts off a steam valve with his machete.] What are you doing? Someone's going to hear us!
I don't know how many more of those I have in me.
[Struck with realization.] Maybe we don't need to cut all the way through. Toph has been teaching me that you shouldn't give one hundred percent of your energy into any one strike. [Rises.] Sokka, take a fighting stance. You've got to be quick and accurate. Hit a series of points and break your opponent's stance. [Strikes Sokka several times.] And when he's reeling back, you deliver the final blow. [Hits him softly on the head.] His own weight becomes his downfall, literally.
Then I'll go to the top of this thing and deliver the final blow.
Everyone inside that wall. The whole world is counting on us.
That's enough! We need to get to the next one!
[Barely misses another fire blast.] Whoa!
Guys, get out of here. I know what I need to do.
[Halting.] This looks like a good spot, Momo. [Looks up to find boulders being hurtled down the wall, nearly crushing him. Yelling.] General Sung, tell your soldiers to stop shooting rocks down here!
[Exhausted.] What I'd give to be a metalbender.
[Assuming a fighting stance.] Momo, get out of here!
Thanks, Momo. I owe you one. [Runs over to the wedge he sliced in the drill.] Now all I need ... [A boulder falls before him.] Actually, that is what I need for once.
[Grins.] I kind of like that one.
I missed you more than you'll ever know, buddy. [Momo flies into Appa to hug him too. Appa licks Aang, which causes Aang to laugh.]
But now that we have Appa back, there's nothing stopping us from telling the Earth King the truth. About the conspiracy and the War.
We need to talk to you.
[Smiles.] See? We're friends, Your Earthiness. [Gives a slight nervous chuckle.]
[Effortlessly breaks free of his earth cuffs and raises his arms.] Over here. [Re-attaches the cuffs.]
[Walks forward.] Well, sir, there's a war going on right now. For the past one hundred years in fact. The Dai Li's kept it secret from you. It's a conspiracy to control the city, and to control you.
Long Feng didn't want us to tell you, so he stole our sky bison to blackmail us. And blackmail is the least of his crimes; he brainwashed our friend!
Right there! Appa bit him!
Oh, yeah. [Hops to in front of the king.] If you come with us to the Outer Wall, we can prove to you that the secret war is real.
I wish it wasn't.
[Points at the drill.] It's still there!
[Momo climbs up Kuei's arm.] We don't have much time. There's a comet coming this summer. Its energy will give the firebenders unbelievable strength. They'll be unstoppable.
Secret files?
[Opens the scroll and reads it.] It's from the Eastern Air Temple.
I can't believe it. There's a man living at the Eastern Air Temple. He says he's a guru.
No, a spiritual expert. He wants to help me take the next step in the Avatar journey. He says he can teach me to control the Avatar State.
[Worriedly.] Split up? We just found Appa and got the family back together! Now you want us to separate?
Well, if I'm going to the Eastern Air Temple, Appa and I can drop you off at Chameleon Bay to see your dad.
Katara? I need to tell you something. [Starts blushing.] I've been wanting to say it for a long time.
[Rubs the back of his head.] Katara, I- [He is cut off by Sokka.]
Yeah.
[Dreamily.] Yeah. Girls are waiting for us. Thanks, positive attitude.
[To Zuko; points to his seat and tries to act casual.] Hey, uh ... I wanted to sit there.
I was just, I wanted to ... okay. [Sits down.]
Wait, is that a woman playing me?
[Cut to wide shot of Team Avatar. Aang extends his arm toward the stage, angry with the actress' bad portrayal.] I don't do that! That's not what I'm like! And I'm not a woman! [Throws hands up in frustration.]
Ugh.
Ugh!
[Angry.] At least the Sokka actor kind of looks like you. That woman playing the Avatar doesn't resemble me at all!
[Standing up.] Argh!
[Turns around and sits down. Sarcastically.] Yeah, that's not you at all.
[Angered.] No, I'm not! I hate this play! [Yanks his hat off and throws it on the ground.]
Overreacting? If I hadn't blocked my chakra, I'd probably be in the Avatar State right now!
Katara, did you really mean what you said in there?
On stage, when you said I was just like a ... brother to you, and you didn't have feelings for me.
But it's true, isn't it? We kissed at the Invasion, and I thought we were gonna be together. But we're not.
Why don't you know?
Well, when is the right time?
Ugh, I'm such an idiot! [Puts down his head on the balcony railing.]
I'll say.
What happened? Where am I?
[Looks up and smiles.] Princess Yue!
[Camera pans to him.] How do I do that?
[Yelling.] Roku, where are you? [A geyser goes off in the trees behind him. He looks around and slowly walks forward. Suddenly, a geyser goes off right in front of him.] Aaahh!
I'm sorry, Roku ... I tried to master the Avatar State ... but I failed.
Where are we going?
What are you doing?
You did it, Roku! You mastered the Avatar State!
[Camera fading to black.] ... what?
[Off-camera; excited.] Hei Bai! [Hugging Hei Bai.] Roku told me I'd find you here!
[Stops hugging him.] I'm happy to see you too. I don't suppose you've seen Avatar Kyoshi around, have you? [Camera fades to black and cuts to Aang riding on Hei Bai. Pointing.] There she is!
That's okay.
You trained the Dai Li? But they're the worst, most corrupt Earthbenders in the world!
But I don't even know his name!
[They pass a faceless monkey spirit.] We're in the Realm of Koh, Hei Bai ... We better be careful. [Kuruk lands in front of them and Aang screams.] Aaahh! [Falls off Hei Bai and lands in some mud.] Koh took your face and replaced it with a bear's face!
No, who is she?
[Glances to the side.] I'm sorry. I know how that feels. [His eyes widen.] Wait! I've seen her! [Cut to Aang's flashback of Koh using Ummi's face.] Koh still has her! When I was in Koh's lair, he showed me Ummi's face!
Hello? Avatar Yangchen? Anyone here?
It's been such an amazing experience to meet my past lives.
Well ... I realized that no Avatar is perfect. They all struggled and made mistakes. Like me.
But it made me wonder - why is the Avatar Spirit a human in every life? Wouldn't it be better if the Avatar was an all powerful spirit that never died?
Now that I've reconnected with all of you, does that mean the Avatar Spirit is okay?
[Cut to Aang, as he sighs heavily.] Okay. Not something to fear.
Maybe I need a little more instruction. Perhaps a demonstration?
[Cut to Aang.] I thought it was ... nice. [Smiles slightly and shrugs.]
[Rubbing his head, confused.] Maybe it's the altitude.
[Gets up.] That one kind of felt hot.
Sorry, Sifu Hotman.
I don't know. Maybe it isn't. Maybe your firebending comes from rage and you just don't have enough anger to fuel it the way you used to.
That's amazing, Toph!
[Cut to an aerial shot of the group.] I learned from the monks, but the original airbenders were the sky bison. [Camera pans above to show a mural of three sky bison. Aang leans back to look at Appa.] Maybe you can give me a lesson sometime, buddy.
[Shot cuts to behind Zuko as he looks at the group.] What do you mean‌? Roku had a dragon, and there were plenty of dragons when I was a kid.
Okay, okay. [Moves his arms in an appeasing manner.] I'm sorry.
[Walks toward Zuko.] Sun Warriors? Well, I know they weren't around when I was a kid.
It's like the monks used to tell me. Sometimes, the shadows of the past can be felt by the present.
[Turning his head toward Zuko.] Appa's right, Zuko. In our group, typically we start our missions with a more up-beat attitude.
[Cut to Appa flying from behind.] Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it.
[Cut to some structures as screen pans right to show more of them.] Okay. We've learned something about architecture. [Cut back to the two walking.] Hopefully, we'll learn something about firebending too. The past can be a great teacher.
[Scared.] Zuko, I think the past is trying to kill me.
There's probably a lot more. Maybe this means we shouldn't be here.
Look, this seems promising. [Cut to Zuko and Aang from the behind, as they see a carving of a person being surrounded by two dragons who are breathing fire at him.] Though I'm not sure what this tells us about the original source of firebending.
[Cut to a part of the carving from below as screen pans right to show more of it.] I thought the dragons were friends with the Sun Warriors.
Zuko, [Zuko stops walking.] something happened to the dragons in the last hundred years. [Zuko closes his eyes.] Something you're not telling me.
[Cut to the both from a side.] But I thought your uncle was ... I don't know, good?
It's locked up!
[Exasperated.] Monkeyfeathers! The solstice again? We can't wait here that long.
Nothing's happening.
[He picks his staff, and Zuko, walking up to the gates, unsheathes his sword.] You know, Zuko, I don't care what everyone else says about you. [Aang nudges Zuko with his elbow.] You're pretty smart.
It says this is something called the Dancing Dragon.
Zuko, get over here! I want you to dance with me!
Just do it.
Let's follow the steps of the statues. [Aang and Zuko take the posture of the statue in front of them and move to their right and left, respectively, taking the postures of the statues in front of them, which pressed similar buttons lying on the ground in front of all the statues. Cut to an aerial shot of the room.] Don't you see? These aren't dance moves. These statues are giving us a lesson. [Cut to Zuko moving through each statue.] I think this is some kind of Sun Warrior firebending form.
Hurray! [Putting his hands down, and rubbing his head.] Wait, what exactly is that?
[Cut to the gemstone as Zuko runs toward it. Aang raises his arms.] Well, don't touch it! [Zuko stops and Aang catches up to him.]
Remember what happened out there with those spikes? [Turns to look at the side and raises his arms again.] I'm just very suspicious of giant glowing gems sitting on pedestals.
[Cut to a worried Aang's face, as he turns to look at the gates of the room, which close.] Oh no, it's another trap!
[Trying to pull his hands from the grates.] I can't move! Zuko, do something!
It stopped.
You had to pick up the glowing egg, didn't you?
[He opens his mouth very widely and yells.] Help!
Well, what do you think we should do?
Please, I don't normally play this card, but ... [Places his palm on his chest.] I'm the Avatar. [Cut to Ham Ghao looking toward the chief from the side, puzzled. Cut to Aang, who stands up and gives a weak smile.] Just hear us out.
[Cut to Aang and Zuko.] Ran and Shaw? There are two of them?
[Cut to an unsure Aang as he places his palm on his neck.] Umm, Mister Sun Chief Sir‌, yeah, I'm not a firebender yet. [Pointing to Zuko.] Couldn't my friend here carry my fire for me?
I'm sorry, I'm just a little nervous. [He takes the flame in his hand and his expression changes to a relieved one.] It's like a little heartbeat.
I can't. [Cut to Aang approaching a rock.] If I walk too fast, my flame will go out. [Climbs up the rock and looks at his flame.]
[He climbs another rock.] But what if I can't control it?
But once they find out I'm the Avatar ...
[Turning to Zuko.] We could turn back now. We've already learned more about fire than we'd hoped. [Aang shows Zuko his flame and gives a weak smile.]
[Looking toward the rocks.] What if they judge us, and attack us?
What's happening‌? [He looks to look at Zuko, who turns his head toward Aang. Aang cringes and quickly returns back to his position, and realizes that his flame is extinguished and gasps. He turns toward Zuko again, and whispers.] Zuko, my fire went out.
Give me some of yours. [He reaches for Zuko's flame and Zuko pushes him behind.]
[Whispering as well.] I can't. [He reaches for Zuko's flame again.]
[Off-screen.] Quit being stingy!
Uh oh.
[In a low voice.] Still think we can take 'em?
[Whispers.] Zuko, I think we're supposed to do the Dragon Dance with them.
Well, I think they want us to do something. Let's just try it.
Wow.
[Cut to the two descending from the side.] Like firebending harmony.
[Looking at Zuko.] So your uncle lied.
[Cut to Aang.] All this time, I thought firebending was destruction. Since I hurt Katara, I've been too afraid and hesitant. But now I know what it really is ... it's energy, and life. [He smiles.]
[Cut to Aang and Zuko demonstrating the Dancing Dragon to the rest of Team Avatar and friends.] With this technique the dragons showed us, Zuko and I will be unstoppable.
[Sheepishly.] Oh, I didn't think you would need it, Sokka. [He holds up an intricately woven necklace decorated with a red flower.]
[Rises to his feet.] Not tangled. Woven! I made you a necklace, Katara. I thought since you lost your other one ...
I don't see why I can't do both.
[Nervously.] You mean, all of you or just your neck? [Puts his right hand behind his head in embarrassment.] I mean, because they both look great!
[Embarrassed.] I ... well, uh ...
[Dismayed.] Thanks.
[Urgently.] Someone's being attacked by a platypus bear!
Make noise! He'll run off!
And then run in zig-zags!
[Holding his hands out in front of him and assuming a fighting stance.] Whoa there!
Aunt who?
What do you know? An umbrella!
Not everyone has the gift, Sokka.
[Rubs nose in disinterest.] Hello.
[Flatly.] Aang.
[Awkwardly.] I guess.
Likewise.
[Breezily.] Good luck with that!
[Refusing the bowl.] I'm good on puffs. [Sokka shrugs and continues eating the puffs; trying to act casual.] So, what do you think they're talking about back there?
[Trying to act cool.] Yeah, dumb stuff like that ... [Tenses a bit and bites his fingers nervously.] Well, I've got to find a bathroom.
Yeah ... when I was in there ...
Wow, that's a big crack.
[Casually.] Yeah, yeah, I knew that already. But did it say anything about a girl?
[Excited.] Yes!
Really? [Rises to his feet joyfully.] Thank you, Aunt Wu!
[Slyly, crossing his arms and leaning in toward her.] They sure are ...
[Ambiguously.] Some stuff. You'll find out.
[Pointing upward.] That cloud kind of looks like a fluffy bunny.
[Awkwardly.] Huh? Sure, I guess. [He pushes Meng away as the camera pans to the right; to Katara.] Hey, Katara, don't you think that cloud look like a flower?
[Slightly nervous.] Since I got you here, uh, there's something I want to tell you. I like you, but more than normal.
[Crushed.] Never mind.
They seem happy, Sokka.
So, Sokka, you know some stuff about ladies, right?
Well, there's this girl.
[Surprised.] You do? And you're okay with it?
[Growing anxious; Meng tries to catch Aang's attention in the background.] She does?
Well, how do I do that?
You can be too nice?
Well, okay ...
See you later ... [Walks away casually and waves hand breezily.]
[Breezily.] Oh, hey, Katara. I didn't see you there.
[Trying to catch her attention.] That's okay. I'm busy with my own stuff.
[Aloof.] So ... papaya.
[Causally, picking an apple from the stand.] You know me. I don't really care what I eat.
[Slightly downcast.] Maybe aloof isn't my style.
[To Momo.] Did you see that?
Excuse me. [Pointing to the flower.] Where can a guy find one of those things?
Not just any flower, a panda lily. I've seen it in action and boy, does it work.
But my heart is telling me to get this flower, [Looks up toward the rim of the mountain.] and Aunt Wu said if I trusted in my heart, I will be with the one I love.
[Cuts to shot of Aang perched on one boulder, Sokka appearing on-screen.] Well, Aunt Wu hasn't been wrong yet. Why should she be wrong about love? [Leaps upward and points in delight at the rim.] There! On the rim!
[Shocked.] Oh no. [Cuts to overhead shot of the volcano.] Aunt Wu was wrong.
There's no time to walk! [Whips out his glider.] Grab on! [He pulls Sokka forward, who shouts in surprise and the two take off.]
[Shyly, raises hand slightly.] Hi, Katara.
But she doesn't even charge.
[Leaps onto the awning of a nearby building; urgently.] Please listen to us! You are all in danger! And we have to get out of here! You can't rely on Aunt Wu's prediction, [Cuts to shot of villagers who gaze up at him, seemingly listening.] you have to take fate into your own hands!
[Brightening.] But they will listen to Aunt Wu!
Well, it's about to become the solution. We're taking fate in our own hands. First, I need to borrow Aunt Wu's cloud reading book.
[Whispering.] Shhh! We don't want anyone to hear us.
Oh, I didn't see you there.
Of course I like you.
Oh, I guess not.
[Casting sad glance to the side.] I know what you mean.
[Blushes and looks at her, surprised.] Huh?
Don't worry. You're going to meet a great guy who's going to completely fall for you. I know it. [Places a hand on her shoulder comfortingly; turns to leave.]
How did you know?
[Blushing.] Oh, thanks ... I guess.
Clouds are made of water and air, so between the two of us, we ought to be able to bend them into any shape we want.
We still can save the village if we act fast. [Gesturing toward Sokka, who stands on the pagoda.] Sokka has a plan.
If any of you are earthbenders, come with me.
Everyone needs to evacuate! We'll come for you when it's safe!
[Sheepishly.] By the way, we kind of borrowed your book.
Can I ask you something?
[Disappointed.] You didn't really see love in my fortune, did you? You just told me what I wanted to hear.
Okay, I got the grub if you guys got the- [The siblings turn away from each other in anger with their arms folded.] hey, where's the campfire? And what happened to the tent?
[Laughs.] Okay, listen guys, harsh words won't solve problems, action will. Why don't you just switch jobs?
[Grinning while gloating.] You see that? Settling feuds and making peace, all in a day's work for the Avatar. [Turns his head to see Momo and Appa fighting over a watermelon. Momo continuously tries to fly away with it, while Appa pins it down. Aang takes the melon and uses airbending to slice it. Momo seems to be complaining about how he got the much smaller half and Appa got the bigger half.] Come on, Momo, that's fair. Appa's got five stomachs. [Appa eats his half of the melon.]
There it is, guys, The Great Divide.
I don't know, a fight over chores is one thing, but these people have been feuding for a hundred years.
Uh, you could share the earthbender and travel together?
[Shouting.] All right here's the deal, you're all going down together and Appa here will fly your sick and elderly across! Does that seem fair? [Both leaders nod in agreement, and the scene fades to show the sick and elderly boarding Appa.]
[To Appa.] Sorry, Appa, you'll have to do this on your own.
[Grinning broadly.] To tell you the truth, I'm not sure. But when have I ever been?
[To the people on Appa.] Appa's going to take good care of you 'till we get there. [To Appa.] See you on the other side, buddy! Yip yip! [Appa roars and takes off. The camera fades to show both groups of people climbing down into the canyon. The tour guide earthbends to form a bridge in a gap in the path.]
Nice bending!
Why'd you do that?
[To the canyon guide.] What was that?
We're trapped in this canyon.
Look, sticking together is the only way to-
[To the canyon guide.] Any ideas?
[Angrily.] Enough! I thought I could help you guys get along, but I guess that's not gonna happen. [Jumps onto a tall rock.] We should split up, Gan Jins on this side and Zhangs on that side. We'll travel in two separate lines. [The two leaders nod at each other and start walking. Aang jumps down to Sokka and Katara.] Sokka, you go with the Zhangs and Katara, you go with the Gan Jins. See if you can find out why they hate each other so much.
Sure would be nice to be sitting around one of those campfires, telling stories and laughing. Its okay Momo, we'll be out of here soon enough, and then we can eat our weight in leechi nuts! [Momo jumps up and snatches a bug out of the air, he eats part of it before offering the rest to Aang.] Nah, I'll wait for the leechi nuts.
I wish I could help these people get along, but it just seems impossible. Anyhow, I guess our biggest problem is getting out of here.
[Jumps down to Katara and Sokka.] Katara, Sokka, will these people cooperate long enough to get out of the canyon?
What are you talking about?
[Over Sokka's frustrated growls.] Okay, okay I get it! Now I need your help, I need everyone together at the base of the canyon wall. [He takes off on his glider and the scene fades to show him landing between the two tribes.] Please everyone, as soon as we get out of here we can eat and then go our separate ways, but I need you all to put your heads together and figure out a way up this cliff.
[Shouting.] Guys, focus! How many times do I have to say it? Harsh words won't solve problems, action will!
You know, I take it back. Harsh words aren't so bad!
[Shocked.] Is that ... food? Everyone smuggled food down here? Unbelievable! You guys put our lives in danger because you couldn't go without a snack for a day? You're all awful! [He looks in wonder at a custard tart, and his stomach growls.] So hungry. Is that an egg custard in that tart? [He turns to see dozens of canyon crawlers approaching, and they all try to flee.]
[Shouting.] Everybody, watch me and do what I do! [He distracts a crawler with a piece of food, leaps on its back, and throws a bag over its snout. The two tribes mimic him, working together.] Now follow me! We're riding out of this hole! [Aang ties a huge bag of food onto a stick and uses it to guide the crawlers up the canyon wall.] Everyone, get off!
[Sighs in frustration.] Wait a second ... Jin Wei? Wei Jin? I know those guys!
No, I mean I really knew them. I might not look it, but I'm a hundred and twelve years old. I was there one hundred years ago on the day you're talking about. [Scene fades to show the two men facing each other. Voice-over.] There seems to be a lot of confusion about what happened. First of all, Jin Wei and Wei Jin weren't enemies. They were brothers, twins in fact, and they were eight; and most importantly, they were just playing a game! The sacred orb from the legend, that was the ball! And the eastern and western gates were the goal posts. Jin Wei had the ball and was running toward the goal when he fell and fumbled it. Wei Jin didn't steal the ball, he picked it up and started running it toward the other goal, but he stepped out of bounds, so the official put him in the penalty box. Not for twenty long years but for two short minutes. [Fades back to Aang.] There was no stealing and no putting anyone in imprison, it was just a game.
Nope, just a regular ball.
That's what the game was called, redemption. As soon as you got the ball from one end to the other, everyone would yell "redemption"! [The tribe leaders look at each other skeptically.] Don't get me wrong, Wei Jin was kind of a slob and Jin Wei was a little stuffy, that much is true. But they respected each other's differences enough to share the same playing field.
Good to see you, boy. Did you miss me? [Appa licks Aang as the Gan Jin leader approaches.]
[Covered in Appa's slobber.] Well, you know I try.
You could call it luck. Or you could call it lying.
I made the whole thing up.
Now where is that custard tart? I'm starving!
You haven't seen your dad in over two years. You must be so excited!
Don't be nervous. He's going to be so happy to see you! [He puts his hand on Sokka's shoulder who smiles.]
Not at all. I'm ready to master the Avatar State. I'll do whatever it takes. [Sokka gets off Appa.] See you in a week. Yip yip!
Uhhh ... hello? You're Guru Pathik, right? [Aang approaches Pathik.] The person who attached the note to Appa's horn?
In your note, [Aang sits.] you said you could teach me how to gain control of the Avatar State. How?
[Takes it and looks at it. Drinks it and quickly spits it out to his left in disgust.] Uggh! It tastes like onion and banana juice!
[Rubs eyes.] What are chakras?
So chakras are pools of spiraling energy in our bodies?
The creek can't flow?
The energy flows! [The water that was blocked by the moss becomes clear. Aang and Pathik smile at each other.]
[Momentarily looks down.] I'll do whatever it takes.
Water Chakra?
[Sees the image of him leaving home.] I ran away. [Sees images of him in the Avatar State at General Fong's base.] I hurt all of those people.
[Holding his stomach.] My Fire Chakra would like to eat something other than onion-banana juice.
I'm never going to firebend again. I can't.
[Loud belch.] Tastes like onions and bananas, but strangely something else. Pickles? [Pathik shrugs, and hums as if to say "I don't know".]
[Choking up.] Can I have some onion-banana juice, please?
Because I never wanted to be.
[An image is shown of the world, with the four nations' territories marked.] Like the four nations.
We're all connected. Everything is connected.
This is the last chakra, isn't it?
[Smiles with determination.] Let's do this.
[Coming out of his meditation.] What? Why would I let go of Katara? I ... I love her!
Why would I choose cosmic energy over Katara? [Aang throws his hands up.] How could it be a bad thing that I feel an attachment to her? Three chakras ago that was a good thing!
I'm sorry, but I can't let go of Katara.
Okay, I'll try.
Katara's in danger! I have to go! [Prepares to exit.]
[From inside the cloud.] I think I see a cave below.
Yeah, blending in is better than hiding out. [Cut to Aang and Katara.] If we get Fire Nation disguises, [Smiling.] we would be just as safe as we would be hiding in a cave.
[Whispering.] I don't know about this. [Cut to a view of Team Avatar from the clothes.] These clothes belong to somebody.
But if it's essential to our survival ... then I call the suit! [Jumps over the wall.]
[Puts on a headband, revealing his whole new Fire Nation disguise.] Ta-dah! Normal kid.
[Blushing, scratching his head.] Uh ... your mom's necklace.
I used to visit my friend Kuzon here a hundred years ago. So, everyone just follow my lead and stay cool. Or, as they say in the Fire Nation, "stay flamin'". [Walks around the building corner. To a man eating meat on a stick.] Greetings, my good hotman.
[Looking at a meat display. Dissapointedly.] Oh, we're going to a meat place?
You guys go ahead. I'll just get some lettuce out of the garbage. [Aang and Katara wave each at each other as the rest enter. Turns around to greet random people on the street.] Hotman. Hotman. Hotman. Hotman. Hotman. Hotman.
[Guiltily.] Who, me?
That's right. [Knocking on his head.] Let the molding begin. [The two guards turn away to leave.]
Yeah, the colonies, of course. The Fire Nation colonies in the Earth Kingdom. [The two guards walk away.]
Sorry, ma'am.
Um ... I have a scar. It's really embarrassing.
[Chuckles.] Just "slob" is fine. Or, uh, Kuzon. [Camera pans out to Aang facing his classmates.]
[Quietly.] We made it through the day Momo, and it was pretty fun.
[Turns around, trying to act innocent.] What monkey?
Wow. [Bows.] You must be one of those popular kids I've been hearing about.
[Waving goodbye to On Ji and Hide.] It was nice meeting you.
I guess I'm just lucky.
I'd love to.
[Undoing his headband.] I got invited to play with some kids after school.
I enrolled in a Fire Nation school, and I'm going back tomorrow.
Every minute I'm in that classroom, I'm learning new things about the Fire Nation. I already have a picture of Fire Lord Ozai. [Holds up the picture.] And here's one that I made out of noodles! [Holds up his picture of Ozai.]
I guess we'll never find out about the secret river then. It goes right to the Fire Lord's palace. We were supposed to learn about it in class tomorrow.
Flamey-o, hotman! [Runs off.]
[Glances around the room as the class recites the oath.] Fire Lord ... forefathers ...
Firebenders ... Fire Lord ... wah, bah, blah, blah. [The class snickers at him as they sit down as the teacher looks on with a stern expression.]
Is that a trick question? The Air Nomads didn't have a formal military. Sozin defeated them by ambush. [The entire class stares at him, dumbfounded.]
I'll just write down my best guess.
[Stopping.] I know, I'm a terrible tsungi hornist.
I was just dancing. You do dances here in the homeland, right?
But what about expressing yourself?
Thanks On Ji. I could show it to you again if you like. Ah! [He jumps as a blast of fire hits the ground at his feet.]
[Nervously.] Just some dance movements.
[Worriedly.] Parents? But-
I'm not ready to leave yet. I'm having fun for once, just being a normal kid. You don't know what it's like, Sokka. You get to be normal all the time.
Listen guys, those kids at school are the future of the Fire Nation. If we want to change this place for the better, we need to show them a little taste of freedom.
I'm gonna throw them, [Starts dancing.] a secret dance party! [Everybody stares at Aang.]
Don't think of it as a dance party, but as a cultural event celebrating the art of fancy footwork! [Dances.]
[To Appa.] Sorry buddy, you should probably wait out back. [Appa grumbles as Aang herds him into the back.] I know, you got fancier feet than anybody. And six of 'em! [Turns around with his hands on his hips, grinning widely.]
[Jumps in front of the stage.] Ladies and gentlemen, the Flamey-O's! [To himself.] Yeah, this ought to get everybody moving. [He looks around at the kids standing shyly at the edge of the cave.]
This is when you start dancing.
Oh boy. Listen guys, dancing isn't something you think about. It's a form of self-expression that no one can ever take away from you.
Sure you do, you have for generations! It just so happens that I know several classic Fire Nation dances. A hundred years ago, this was known as the 'Phoenix Flight'. [The students ooh and aah as Aang runs low to the ground.] And, this was the 'Camelephant Strut'.
And this is how they do it in the ballrooms of Ba Sing Se. [He starts tapping his feet from side to side and On Ji joins him.]
Yeah, that's it! That's the sound of happy feet. [The rest of the kids start dancing with them.] All right, go with that! Everybody freestyle!
[Smiling.] Take my hand.
Don't worry about them. [Smiles.] It's just you and me right now.
Uh-oh. [Aang starts running away through the crowd as the soldiers chase him. One soldier sees a boy with a headband, and grabs him.]
I don't know, it was just a dance party, that's all.
[Enthusiastically.] Great, you're back!
What's for dinner?
It's coming from over there!
Let's go meet him!
[Sokka and Aang approach Katara; yelling.] Nice to meet you!
Hey! That guy's gotta be running somewhere. Maybe we're near a village? And I bet that village has a market!
Great hat! [Tries on the hat.] I'll trade you some nuts for it.
[Aang and Sokka enter the shop.] No, she doesn't. We saw you earthbending.
Thanks. I'll make sure Appa doesn't eat all your hay.
You must have really inspired him.
[Surprised.] What?
[Confused.] And ... why would they do that?
[Snapping small puffs of air at a sooty copper fritillary butterfly; dismissively.] Sure, sure. I got it.
[Continues snapping puffs of air; still dismissive.] Yeah, yeah. Just relax. You're taking all the fun out of this.
[Humored.] Exactly! That's fun stuff!
[Concerned.] Katara, what's wrong?
Maybe she's right. What do you say, Sokka?
[Katara and Sokka flee. Aang whispers to Appa before joining them.] Go hide.
I wish I knew how to make a hurricane!
The warden would run away and we'd steal his keys!
I'm just tossing ideas around.
No, it's not. [Points to smokestacks.] Look at the smoke! I bet they're burning coal. In other words, earth.
[Generates an air funnel and holds it between his hands; to Katara and Sokka.] Guys! Throw me some coal!
Where's Momo? [Camera zooms in to close-up shot of Aang, Katara, and Sokka, the siblings sitting next to each other with bored faces, and Aang standing with his back to the camera. Momo screeches and the gang looks around.]
Hang on, Momo! [Aang uses his airbending to fly to the top of the tree, jumping from trunk-to-trunk to get higher. He finds the traps' mechanisms, undoes them, and carefully lowers Momo to the ground where Katara and Sokka are waiting. They open the trap together and the lemur runs out with one of the lychee nuts in his mouth. Katara and Sokka look on as Momo gets on his hind legs and eats it as though nothing has happened. Sokka grunts in frustration and facepalms. When Aang lands, he looks up to see the other two animals seemingly crying out to him for help.] All right, you too. [Jumps up to them.]
[Inching his way upside-down to the traps on the tree branch. They fall before he can reach them.] That works.
[Confused.] What? Why wouldn't we fly?
[To Appa.] Sokka's just jealous 'cause he doesn't have an arrow.
[While hanging upside-down from Appa's right horn with feet sticking out in the air.] He's right.
[Aang steps over, now wearing a backpack. Momo is sitting on the top.] Who knows? Walking might be fun. [Cut to the forest at a later time. Between trees the group trudges along, with Sokka in front, followed by Aang and Momo, Katara, and Appa.] Walking stinks! How do people go anywhere without a flying bison?
[Complaining.] I'm tired of carrying this pack.
That's a great idea. Hey, Sokka's instincts, would you mind-
Sokka, your shirt! [Sokka yells; Katara clears a fire on Sokka's shirt with waterbending.]
Nice work, Sokka! How'd you do that?
[Amazed.] You just took out a whole army almost single-handed.
[Laughing; looking at The Duke.] Ha, ha, Pipsqueak, that's a funny name. [The Duke sniffs his nose, as the camera pans upward to Pipsqueak.]
[Side-shot; Aang looks taken aback for a second before replying in an upbeat tone.] It's hilarious!
You guys have a hideout?
I'll get up on my own. [Leaps up into the trees with airbending.]
[While passing through with Momo.] Nice place you got!
Thanks Jet.
Sokka! Look what the Duke gave me! [Aang is wearing a bag and pulls a small pellet from it. With a sly grin, he tosses it next to Momo, where it explodes with a pop. Momo puffs up like a startled cat. He hisses and lunges for the bag. Momo sits on Aang's shoulder and tosses several pellets at his feet. Aang dances about wildly.] Ow! Quit it!
What?
He's not messed up, he's just got a different way of life, a really fun way of life.
What can we do?
Sorry, Sokka.
Really? [Aang and Katara stop and look at one another.] Sokka apologized?
[Airbends himself back on the ground.] What about me?
Look, there's another steam vent. [Aang and Katara walk off in its direction.]
[Later.] I bet that's enough, and I'm not just saying that to be lazy. [Around them, over a dozen geysers flow into the river.]
I thought we agreed to meet Jet back at the hideout.
Hey, those are the red barrels he got from the Fire Nation.
Because Jet's gonna blow up the dam.
I've gotta stop him. [He takes off.]
I need to get to the dam.
I'm not gonna fight you, Jet.
[In pain from the fall.] Sokka's still out there, he's our only chance.
Sokka didn't make it in time.
We thought you were going to the dam. How come you went to the town instead?
The Earth Kingdom city of Omashu! [Camera pans up from the group to show the entire pyramid structured city of Omashu. Close-up of an excited Aang.] I used to always come here to visit my friend Bumi.
[Back view of the siblings, with Aang and the city visible between them. Excitedly.] Well let's go, slow pokes. The real fun's inside the city!
[Shot of Aang looking up.] So what am I supposed to do? [In a slightly sarcastic tone.] Grow a mustache?
[Scratching underneath the wig.] Ugh. This is so itchy. [Cut to a broader shot; Aang is standing beside Appa. To Appa.] How do you live in this stuff?
[In an old man's voice.] Now let's get to skippin', young whipper-snappers. The big city awaits!
You guys are going to love Omashu. [Cut to front view shot as the three friends walk toward the gate. Aang looks over his shoulder at Sokka.] The people here are the friendliest in the world.
[Close-up, broadly smiling; somewhat nervously.] Just keep smiling!
[In old man voice, poking the chest of the sentry.] My business is my business, young man, [Shot of the boulder crashing down due to the guards lack of concentration beside Katara and Sokka as they jump up slightly from the impact; close-up of Aang pointing a finger at the camera.] and none of yours! [Close-up of the guard, taken aback by the threateningly pointing finger just centimeters from his face.] I've got half a mind to [Close-up of Sokka, eyes and mouth wide open in shock at Aang's audacity to talk to the sentry like that, and Katara, shaking her head with eyes wide open in shock.] bend you over my knee and paddle your backside!
[Sokka and Katara are still in shock in the background; in old man voice.] Name's Bonzu Pippinpaddleopsicopolis, the Third, [Sokka raises a questioningly eyebrow while Katara walks up, smiling friendly.] and these are my grandkids.
[In old man voice.] Good idea!
[Back to regular voice; voice-over.] This is the Omashu delivery system. [Camera shows the top of the city.] Miles and miles of tubes and chutes.
[Voice-over.] Earthbending brings the packages up, and gravity brings them down.
[Excitedly.] They do get their mail on time, [Close-up of Aang.] but my friend Bumi found [Squints eyes mischievously.] a better use for these chutes.
[Unsurely.] Um ... The mail system?
[Uncomprehending.] A package-sending system?
[Close-up of a crazed smiling Bumi, and a broadly smiling Aang.] Bumi, you're a mad genius!
[Raising one finger to emphasize his words; the cart rocking back and forth, creaking.] One ride. Then we're off to the North Pole. Airbender's honor.
[Excitedly.] I'm on it!
[Excitedly.] Yeah! Good idea! That'll make us go even faster!
Sorry!
[Sheepishly.] Two cabbages please.
Thanks, but I don't eat meat.
[Close-up.] I'm from ... Kangaroo Island!
[Standing up, throwing his hands in the air.] Okay, you caught me. [Frontal shot of the three friends.] I'm the Avatar. Doing my Avatar thing, keeping the world safe. Everything checks out. [Aang looks underneath table.] No firebenders here. So, good work, everybody! [Pulling Katara and Sokka into a hug.] Love each other, [Cut to a dismayed looking king.] respect all life, [Cut to a shot of the threesome walking backward toward the exit.] and don't run with your spears. We'll see you next time!
[Momo jumps off Aang's shoulders and onto a bed.] He did say it was newly refurbished.
[Close-up; worried.] I wonder what these challenges are gonna to be.
[Excitedly pointing at something at the other side of the room.] The air vents!
[Turning to Sokka.] We can't, but Momo can!
[Hopeful.] Momo, I need you to find Appa and bust us outta here!
Go on, boy, get Appa!
[Voice-over.] Appa's a ten-ton flying bison; I think he could figure something out.
[Alarmed.] Sokka? [Switch to Aang's point of view; the other beds are empty.] Katara? [Frontal shot as Aang turns toward the guard.] Where are my friends?
[Frontal shot; unsure.] And if I fail?
[Scratching his head.] I ... guess it's fine.
Really?
[Aggressively.] I don't have time for your crazy games! [Close-up of King Bumi.] Give me my friends back! We're leaving!
[Cut back to a side shot of Aang and Bumi; serious.] I'll do what you want.
There! Enjoy your lunch! I want my friends back now!
Okay! Found him!
Come here, Flopsie. [Flopsie jumps down behind Aang, startling both him and the bunny.] Huh?
Flopsie, wait! Flopsie! [Cut to Bumi laughing. Back to Aang chasing the bunny.] Flopsie!
Wait a minute. [Close-up of Flopsie snarling. Cut to behind Aang.] Flopsie?
Flopsie!
[Aang jumps up to where Katara and Sokka. Both are encased in crystal to their shoulders.] Guys, are you okay?
Come on! I'm ready for the next challenge.
So ... you're saying whoever I point to, that's the person I get to fight?
I ... choose ... you. [Aang points to the king.]
Can I fight the guy with the axe instead?
That's not fair! You said you would release my friends if I finished your tests.
How am I supposed to know his name?
Yeah?
Okay. So back to the challenges. I got a key from the waterfall, I saved his pet, and I had a duel.
Well, everything was different than I expected.
Well, they weren't straight forward. To solve each test, I had to think differently than I usually would. I know his name.
I solved the question the same way I solved the challenges. As you said a long time ago, I had to open my brain to the possibilities. [The king laughs with the same odd snort Bumi did a hundred years ago.] Bumi, you're a mad genius.
Thank you for your wisdom, but before we leave, I have a challenge for you.
Sokka, the arrow is on Appa's head.
[Excitedly.] Come on, let's get busy! [Holds up some pamphlets.]
I just finished dropping all the leaflets. Has anyone come in with news about Appa?
Wow, you're right! Patience really pays off! [Opens the door, revealing the "original" Joo Dee has returned.] Joo Dee?
Why are you here?
[Angrily yelling; during this brief argument, Aang is shown as a chibi and his head turns scarlet red.] We don't care about the rules and we're not asking permission! [Camera cuts to Joo Dee's horrified face. She slowly backs out of the house as Aang continues to yell at her.] We're finding Appa on our own and you should just stay out of our way! [Slams the door as she exits.]
[Calming down.] I don't care! From now on, we do whatever it takes to find Appa!
[Turning from the leaflet back to Katara.] Katara, we have to give him a chance.
Katara, we don't have any leads. If Jet says he can take us to Appa, we have to check it out.
There's nothing here.
[Sadly.] We missed him. [An old white haired man with a push-broom crosses behind the slumping Aang.]
[Aang swiftly moves closer to the man.] What island? Where's Appa?
We've got to get to Whaletail Island! [Pauses.] Where's Whaletail Island? [Dejectedly.]
I don't care. We have a chance to find Appa! We have to try!
Don't worry, on the way back we'll be flying!
I bet they have Appa here in the city. Maybe he's in the same place they took Jet! Where did they take you?
We need to find a way to jog his real memories.
[Jealously.] A bad one.
[Knocks away two agents with airbending.] Long Feng is escaping!
You do have Appa! Tell me where he is!
[Gets into a fighting position.] You're definitely not!
Jet, it's me, Aang! [Runs back.] You don't have to do this!
Jet, I'm your friend! Look inside your heart!
He can't make you do this! [Cut to a close-up of Jet's face as he hangs his head, while panting and sweating.] You're a Freedom Fighter!
[Sadly.] Don't be.
Appa's gone! Long Feng beat us here.
I don't think it's gonna matter!
What is it, Momo?
Appa!
[Happily crying.] I missed you, buddy.
[Turns around and silences Toph.] Shh! I know you can see underground, but don't ruin the surprise. Just watch. [Blows a note on the flute. A groundhog-type creature pops out of a hole in the ground and mimics the note.] Yeah! [Plays another note and another groundhog mimics it.] I'm putting an orchestra together.
I'm learning the elements as fast as I can. I practice hard every day with Toph and Katara. I've been training my arrow off!
[Opening a map and shows it to Katara.] Your turn, Katara. Where would you like to go on your mini-vacation?
Oh, yeah, I've been there. It's a pristine natural ice spring. And I usually don't use the word "pristine". [Cut to the symbol on the map.] It's one of nature's wonders.
Must've changed ownership since I was here. [Laughs sheepishly.]
No worries, I clean up easy. [Airbends the drink off of his clothes.]
[Shrugs.] Thanks, I try.
The Southern Temple.
[Nervously.] Uh, are fruit pies an agricultural product?
[Examines the picture of the library.] Wow, shouldn't be too hard to find a place like this out here.
[To Appa.] Don't worry, buddy. I'm not making you go underground ever again. You can stay out here with Toph. [Walks off camera.]
Nothing. We just like architecture.
What do you have against humans?
Ow. [Frontal shot.] Uh, yeah, I'll vouch. We will not abuse the knowledge in your library, good spirit. [Side shot.] You have my word. [They bow to Wan Shi Tong.]
[Cut to him.] Uh ... oh, I know! [Grabs his wanted poster out of his shirt and shows it to Wan Shi Tong.] Hah!
[Holds the illustration up to show Sokka and Katara.] Hey, look at these weird lion turtle things.
I always knew I was special.
[Walks in with Katara and Zei.] Sokka, where are you going?
[Looking at a room full of ashes.] Firebenders.
Wow, I got to hand it to you, Sokka. You picked the best mini-vacation for sure.
[Narrows his eyes.] Great, you must have broken it.
We had no choice. Please, we're just desperate to protect the people we love.
What are you doing?
[Runs back to Katara, Zei, and Sokka.] We've gotta get back to the surface!
Why are we doing this?
You can't possibly check every single date.
[Pushing the lever.] Come on, eclipse.
[Stands up and walks toward Toph.] Where's Appa?
[Anxiously.] Wait! Four days? The invasion's in four days?
[Half-heartedly.] I guess.
[He makes some fast and dramatic ninja-like moves as he speaks.] Your days of tyranny are over, Fire Lord! I'm bringing you down.
Oh no!
It was just a dream, Momo. I still have my pants. [Stands up.] Well, I better keep training.
A couple hours. I got a lot more skills to refine if I'm gonna fight Ozai.
You don't get it, do you? My form is bad, I'm sloppy, and I still don't know any firebending. Not even the basics.
Okay, well I still have to work on everything else. I better spend the whole day training.
[Wide shot of the group on the cliffside with the camera slowly zooming out.] Good night, Katara. Good night, Sokka. Good night, Toph. Good night, Appa. Good night, Momo. Good night, Appa and Mo-
[Frontal shot as he points outward.] Your days of tyranny are over, Fire Lord. [Scowls.] I'm bringing you down! [Looks down momentarily; confidently.] And this time, I brought pants.
Math test? Oh no! I forgot all about the math test!
I've gotta be ready.
But I forgot my pants and my math test.
Sokka, get up! I needa know what day it is!
Sokka, you've gotta get up drill your rock-climbing exercises.
In one of my dreams, you were running from Fire Nation soldiers, trying to climb this cliff, [Camera turns to show an annoyed look on Sokka's face.] but you were too slow and they got you!
[While pointing at the cliff nearby.] Then climb that cliff! Climb it fast!
[Turning around to her.] Don't drink that!
In my dream, we were right in the middle of the invasion, and you had to stop to use the bathroom! [He puts his hands between his legs and squeezes them together.] We died because of your tiny bladder. [He turns to Katara.] And you need to start wearing your hair up. In my dream, your hair got caught in a train, and-.
[He takes a deep breath before finally speaking.] You're right. I'm losing my mind.
It's like every time I think about how stressed I am, I just end up more stressed. I'm like a big growing snowball of nerves.
[Close-up of Aang sweating.] I feel ... really warm.
Like there's this warm feeling all around me. This heat. [Becoming frantic again.] Like I'm in the Fire Lord's palace and he's shooting a bunch of fireballs at me! And the whole world is being engulfed in flames!
You know what's bothering me. I have to fight the Fire Lord in a few days.
You said it yourself! He's the baddest man on the planet! I'm supposed to defeat him and save the world!
Okay! But what can I do to feel better?
[Looking up at her.] Pound away.
[The pillars causing him pain.] Ow! Toph ... I ... think ... this ... is ... bruising ... me!
Thanks for everything, guys.
[He turns his head away.] Uh, I kinda think I sorta might slightly feel a little better. [He looks back at his friends.] Maybe.
[Turns away on hands and knees.] It's the nightmares. They just get worse and worse.
[Momentarily looking back.] No. That won't help. Nothing helps. There's only one thing I can do! I'm going to stay awake straight through to the invasion!
Invasion. All aboard for the invasion.
I told you, I can't go back to sleep.
[Walking toward the cliff edge. Katara turns and moves a bit to follow.] Actually, staying up all night has given me some time to think. And I've realized some big things, Katara.
I see everything so clearly now. What really matters. Why I'm really doing this. [He turns around to look at Katara.] I'm doing it to save the world. But more than that. I'm doing it for the people I love. [Side shot of Aang and Katara near each other.] I'm doing it for you, Katara.
I'm saying, I love you! [He kisses her. After he pulls back, she embraces and kisses him back.]
What our hearts have been telling us to do for a long, long time. Baby, [He moves Katara down to the side.] you're my forever girl. [Aang puckers up his lips for another kiss.]
[He quickly turns around to face Katara.] Oh, I guess I kinda drifted off into a daydream.
[He pauses to think for a moment.] Uh, living underwater?
Put 'em up, Fire Lord!
[Standing in front of the "Ozai" tree in a fighting stance.] Ozai's defense is impeccable. I'll have to try a different approach.
You think you're untouchable, don't you, Mr. Fire Lord?
Momo, did you hear something? [Turns back.]
That's more like it. I'm so tired that for a second there, I imagined you were talking to me. [Momo tilts his head in confusion. Everyone is seen walking forward and watching Aang.] Oh, Momo, let me explain. [Aang begins chattering like Momo. Katara and Sokka share a look of confusion, as Toph merely stands there with a slightly annoyed look. Momo chitters back, in which Aang laughs before chittering again. Katara interrupts him.]
[Sighs.] Look, I appreciate what you guys are saying, but the stress and the nightmares. They were just too much. Staying awake is the best way for me to deal with it.
You guys, come on.
Sokka, what do we do?
[Pointing.] About that!
Come on, guys. We're all on the same side.
I just need to jump in a cold waterfall!
Oh, look. Another hallucination. An imaginary bed made out of clouds.
Look! You guys keep telling me that I need to sleep, but I can't! The invasion's tomorrow!
No, Katara! There's still so much I haven't learned. I don't need sleep. What I need is practice. Quick, hit me! [He begins to wobble.]
You really think so? [Katara nods.]
Thanks, guys. [He nods, yawns, and rubs his eyes. Katara aids him to the bed, where he lies down.] You know what? I think I am ready. [The other three watch as he falls asleep quickly. He falls into another dream, meeting with Ozai again.] Your days of tyranny are over, Fire Lord!
[Smiles smugly.] No, Fire Lord Ozai. You're not wearing any pants.
[Cuts to a wide shot, showing the gang and the other travelers surrounding a small campfire. The Storyteller, having finished his story, is going around collecting coins from the other travelers.] Aren't airbender stories the greatest? [Talking to Katara and Sokka, who are sitting next to him.]
I laugh at gravity all the time. [Chuckling to himself.] Gravity.
[Happily.] Hey! Thanks for the story.
[Having given up trying to find a coin.] It means a lot to hear airbender stories. It must have been a hundred years ago your great grandpa met them.
[Sitting on Appa's neck, steering. He is talking to Katara and Sokka, who are riding in Appa's saddle.] Hey, we're almost at the Northern Air Temple. This is where they had the championships for Sky Bison polo.
[Excitedly.] Hey, guys, look at this!
[His face falls as he sees the 'airbenders', and after Katara's excited outburst, he leans back and scowls while crossing his arms.] No, they're not.
[Bitterly. He is glaring at the direction of the people flying around the temple.] Gliding maybe, but not flying. You can tell by the way they move, they're not airbending. Those people have no spirit.
[Nonchalantly, but with a smirk.] Yeah, I know. But I can do more than fancy gliding.
[Annoyed; his face mimics the one Teo has just drawn.] It's great.
[Rubs his head, embarrassed.] Thanks.
[Monotonously.] This place is unbelievable.
No, just unbelievable. [Walks away.]
This is supposed to be the history of my people.
Ugh!
It's nice to see that at least one part of the temple that isn't ruined.
[He turns to the mechanist and yells angrily at him.] Do you know what you did!? You just destroyed something sacred! For a stupid bathhouse!
[Points at the mechanist.] This whole place stinks! [Using his airbending, Aang flips the crane contraption off of the edge of the building.]
This is a sacred temple! You can't treat it this way! [Walks closer to the mechanist.] I've seen it when the monks were here! I know what it's supposed to be like!
What are you doing? Who said you could be here?
Our gliders.
Nature knows where to stop.
I just can't get over it. There's not a single thing that's the same.
[He turns away from the door and his friends.] I'm sorry. This is the last part of the temple that's the same as it was. I want it to stay that way.
Thanks. [All three start to walk away.]
Spirit.
Spirit. That's the something you're talking about.
Just make sure you keep your mouth closed so you don't swallow a bug! [Shows Momo flying by and eating a bug.]
Even though Teo's not an airbender, he really does have the spirit of one! [Aang lands beside him on the building.] I've been thinking. If you want to see what's in that room, I'd be happy to open the door for you.
This is a nightmare.
[Accusingly.] You're making weapons for the Fire Nation!
When are they coming?
You can't give them more weapons.
The deal's off.
Get out of here! [Slaps him in the face with an air swipe; continues off screen.] You're leaving empty-handed!
I'll tell you how. We have something they don't. [Points to the sky.] Air power. We control the sky. That's something the Fire Nation can't do. We can win!
Good. We'll need it.
[Jumping off Appa.] We'll have to start without it.
We've got them on the run! We need more slime!
Look! They're retreating! [Cheers from crowd.]
You know what? [Cut to close-up panning shot of Sokka, Katara, Aang, Teo, and the mechanist.] I'm really glad you guys all live here now. [Cut to shot above Aang picking up a hermit crab.] I realized, it's like the hermit crab. [Cut to close-up of Aang's hands surrounding the hermit crab.] Maybe you weren't born here, but you found this empty shell and made it your home. And now you protect each other.
Momo! [Dives into the water.] Oh Momo! [Dives again and Momo flies to Aang.] Hahahahaha! You found me, buddy! [Looks down at the water in distaste and airbends up to Appa's saddle, where he stands dripping in sludge.] Hey guys, I think this river's polluted. [Airbends mud off himself, splattering the rest of Team Avatar with mud, which causes them to cry out in disgust.]
Hey, maybe we can get food there! [Points at a village in the middle of the river.]
Now you look just like a little hill with horns! Bye, buddy!
Thanks for the ride! [Waves his hand to Dock, who waves back.]
Let's just get what we need and go. [Smiling to Katara, who smiles back.]
But we just saw you. You're even wearing the same clothes. [Close-up of his hat.] The only difference is your hat.
I don't get it.
What?
What's the matter Katara?
He doesn't look sick. You okay, buddy? [Appa groans and Aang pulls out Appa's purple tongue.] His tongue is purple! That can't be good. Katara, can you heal him?
Yeah, are the people ... happier?
Is that why this place seems so festive?
Spirit magic doesn't work that way, Sokka. It's more like ... [He waves his body with arms in the air making similar gestures to indicate spirit magic. Katara storms away from the two.]
What's the matter, buddy? [Katara leaves Team Avatar.] It's her! [Excited, waves his hand to Katara and puts on his headband.] Hello, Painted Lady Spirit!
[Jumps up the hill.] Excuse me, I don't mean to bother you, but my friend's sick and we're on kind of a tight schedule. [Continues to follow her down the hill as she crosses the river.] Wait! But I'm a great bridge between your world and mine! [Aang freezes some water to form stepping stones to cross the river.] I know Hei Bai! We're close personal friends! [Katara moves faster, and Aang jumps on a wooden bridge. Katara runs out of the river onto the docks and notices Aang's reflection in the water. She looks up and sees Aang running across a roof.] Heeey! [He suddenly hits a pole, Katara flinches and feels sorry for him but continues on across the river to the other side. She stops to look out at the village thinking she is safe but Aang drops in front of her.] My name's Aang. I'm the Avatar. [Lifts his headband and points at his arrow.]
Yeah, me too. I hate that. [Looks at Katara's face from behind the veil.] You know, you're really pretty, for a spirit. I don't meet too many spirits, but the ones I do meet, not very attractive. [Looks at Katara suspiciously. Tries to look under the hat.]
You seem familiar too.
[Suspicious.] No, you really seem familiar.
Katara?
[Shocked.] You're the Painted Lady? [Pointing at Katara.] But how?
So you've been sneaking out at night? Wait, is Appa even sick?
I can't believe you lied to everyone, so you could help these people.
[Happily.] No, I think it's great! You're like a secret hero!
You wanna destroy this factory?
[Defensively.] Hey, I just found out this morning!
Fire Nation soldiers are heading toward the village!
[Wiping away tears.] He really does have a heart, doesn't he?
Aha, I knew it! I knew you were the same guy. You're the shop owner and the boat guy.
[Annoyed.] No, I just saw you! You switched hats and called yourself a different name!
[Unimpressed.] I think I like "the man with a sword for a hand" better.
[Cuts back to him and Katara, still hugging, Sokka sitting close by.] All right, now I'm getting scared.
I bet if we take a little walk around town, we'll find out what these people did to the environment to make the spirits mad.
[Proudly.] Helping people ... that's what I do.
[Off-camera while Sokka peers into a room.] She could be home any minute.
Okay, that's pretty creepy.
We shouldn't be doing this.
[Nervously.] Guys, I don't know about this ...
[Sticking his tongue out in disgust.] Great ...
[Whispering to Toph.] I'd steer clear of the sea prunes.
Close enough.
This has got to be the nicest natural setting in the Fire Nation. I don't see anything that would make a spirit mad around here.
[Catches sight of a villager walking past.] Excuse me, sir. Can you tell us anything about the spirit that's been stealing people?
Old Man Ding?
Did you get a good look at the spirit that took you?
I didn't know spirits made prisons like this. Who brought you here?
We have to stop Hama!
Give up! [Takes a fighting stance.] You're outnumbered!
This feels weird!
It's okay!
[Viewing the city, his back to the camera; in a somewhat shocked tone.] I can't believe it. I know the War has spread far, [Turning toward the camera sadly.] but Omashu always seemed ... untouchable.
No, I'm going in to find Bumi.
[Angrily.] What? If he's still what?
This isn't about finding a teacher. This is about finding my friend.
That answer your question?
[Quickly tackles Sokka into a wall in order to slience him; in a somewhat cheerful tone.] Shh! Stop making so much noise. It's just a purple pentapus.
Thank you, sewer friends.
Somewhere he can't earthbend. Somewhere made of metal.
So, is King Bumi with you guys? Is he leading the resistance?
Actually there's another path to freedom. You could leave Omashu. You're directing all your energy to fight the Fire Nation. [The camera pans to the right, showing several Earth Kingdom soldiers.] But you're outnumbered. You can't win. Now's the time to retreat, so you can live to fight another day.
[He turns around.] No. I'm not leaving until I find Bumi.
Sorry Momo, I'll feed you later.
Flopsie!
Come on, Flopsie. [He climbs on top of Flopsie.] You gotta help me find Bumi. Yip Yip! [Flopsie does not move a muscle.] Oh ... I guess that doesn't work with you. Let's go!
[Sadly.] We looked everywhere. No Bumi.
It's from the Fire Nation governor. He thinks we kidnapped his son. [Switch to another view. Aang is shown standing at the other side of the campfire, reading the message.] So ... he wants to make a trade. His son [Zoom to Aang's surprised face while he continues dramatically, his eyes widening.] for King Bumi.
I don't think so. I'm sure the governor wants his son back as much as we want Bumi. [Smiling at the sleeping baby he holds against his chest.] It's a new day. I have a good feeling about this.
He's here. We're ready to trade.
Bumi!
Hang on! We're gonna get you out of here.
It's just like old times, isn't it, Bumi?
It's good to see you too!
Hang on, Bumi! Our ride's here!
[Shocked.] You could earthbend? All along?
[Slightly annoyed and angry.] I don't understand. Why didn't you free yourself? Why did you surrender when Omashu was invaded? What's the matter with you, Bumi?
[Cut to a close-up of an annoyed Aang, counting along on his fingers as he sums up the different jings.] I know! There's positive jing when you're attacking, and negative jing when you're retreating.
[He looks shocked at his three raised fingers.] There are three jings?
[Starting to understand.] That's why you surrendered, isn't it?
[Disappointed.] I guess I need to find someone else to teach me earthbending.
[Happily.] Hey, Momo!
Okay. I'm ready for some training.
Are we taking a break?
[While raising his blindfold and turning to face Sokka.] Sokka, sneak attacks don't work if you yell it out loud.
Uh guys, I thought we were supposed to be training me.
Yeah!
[While holding up a silver piece.] So, guys. What are we gonna get with our last silver piece?
Flamey-O, Toph.
Toph got us money. [Grabs an apple and takes a bite out of it as he sits down.] She scammed one of those guys in town who moves the shells around all sneaky-like. [He mimics the scam artist moving the shells with his hand. Katara's expression shows disapproval.]
[Stands up.] Katara, [Slightly lifts his headband to reveal his airbender tattoo and bows.] I'll personally make you an Avatar Promise that we won't make a habit of doing these scams.
[Excited.] Wow, how does it work?
[Rubs his eye.] Well. I, uh-
[He and Sokka sit straight.] Yes, ma'am.
Sure. [Leans his head closer to Sokka.]
I gotta say, Sokka, you continue to impress me with your ideas.
I can't believe we forgot Toph can't write.
I guess Plan B is we send a note to Toph pretending it's from Katara.
Do you think this scam of theirs should be taking this long?
Where do you think anyone is? [The assassin is seen walking across a rooftop behind them. Aang hears him inhaling and becomes shocked when he turns and sees him.] Sokka, watch out! [He grabs Sokka as they dodge a blast from the assassin and take cover behind an Ozai statue.] It's Sparky-Sparky-Boom Man!
We should split up. He can't chase us both.
[Blushing and eyes sparkling.] I know who I'm going to ask.
[Catches up to Katara.] Hey, Katara, so, I was wondering if ...
Every time I try to ask Katara to the dance, something goes wrong. [Cut to the paper as Iroh finishes drawing steam on a cup of tea.] Maybe we're just not meant to be together.
That's it! [The clouds dissipate and Iroh reacts startled.] I know how I'll ask Katara to the dance!
[Turning to Katara, grinning.] You would?
So, did you figure out what route we're going to take?
Katara, it's okay. I know I was upset about losing Appa before, but I just want to focus on getting to Ba Sing Se and telling the Earth King about the solar eclipse.
So, you guys are headed to Ba Sing Se, too?
Um, four tickets for the ferry to Ba Sing Se, please.
Uh ... no one told us we had to have passports.
That won't be necessary.
Are the other Kyoshi Warriors around?
I'm doing fine. Would everybody stop worrying about me?
I'll talk to the lady for you.
But she's pregnant and all of her stuff was stolen! You have to make an exception!
What if we gave them our tickets?
But ...
Don't worry, you'll get to the city safely. I'll lead you through the Serpent's Pass.
I don't know. The monks used to say that hope was just a distraction, so maybe we do need to abandon it.
Hope is not going to get us into Ba Sing Se and it's not going to help find Appa. We need to focus on what we're doing right now and that's getting across this path.
You saw what I did out there. I was so angry about losing Appa that I couldn't control myself. I hated feeling like that.
[Bows before her.] Thank you for your concern, Katara. [Exits.]
[Blasts the Serpent back with a burst of air.] I'll distract it. Katara, get everyone across! [Takes off on his glider.]
[Sheds some tears.] I've been going through a really hard time lately. But you've made me ... hopeful again.
I thought I was trying to be strong. But really I was just running away from my feelings. Seeing this family together, so full of happiness and love, it's reminded me how I feel about Appa ... and how I feel about you.
I promise, I'll find Appa as fast as I can. I just really need to do this.
I know. Thank you, Katara. You ready, Momo? [Aang and Momo fly off. The rest wave goodbye.]
Sorry Momo, Appa's going to have to wait.
[Stops bending at the sound of his name; Momo lands on his head.] Yes, Master Pakku?
[Jumps off the ground with airbending.] I wouldn't say mastered, but check this out.
I wasn't there when the Fire Nation attacked my people. [Determined.] I'm going to make a difference this time.
Yip-yip!
I'll take it from here, boy.
[Brightening.] Appa!
Thanks for the rescue, buddy!
[Shocked.] You've got to be kidding me ...
[Clearly exhausted, placing his hands on his head.] I can't do it ... I can't do it.
[Dimly.] I must have taken out a dozen Fire Navy ships, but there's just too many of them. I can't fight them all.
[Solemnly.] I'm just one kid.
[Brightening.] The spirits! [Raises head, startling Momo.] Maybe I can find them and get their help!
[Waves arms out in gesture.] Or maybe they'll unleash a crazy amazing spirit attack on the Fire Nation! [The two girls look at him oddly; Aang looks at them and straightens up.] Or wisdom. That's good, too.
[Walking up to the door.] So, is this the way to the Spirit World?
[Runs to the back of the oasis and rolls around on the ground.] I never thought I'd miss grass this much!
You're right, Yue. I can feel ... something. It's so tranquil. [Positions himself to meditate.]
[Angrily.] How about some quiet? Come on guys, I can hear every word you're saying!
Hello? I'm sorry to disturb you. I just really need to find the Moon and the Ocean Spirits.
Yes, I need -
Come back!
[Looking at him; surprised.] Roku!
Roku, the Water Tribe's under attack. I need to find the Ocean and the Moon Spirits.
Who?
You're just a curly tailed blue nose.
[Startled.] Aaahhh! [Aang takes a deep breath and speaks with his and Avatar Roku's voices combined.] Show no fear. Show no emotion at all.
Hello? I-I'm looking for a spirit named 'Koh'.
[Emotionlessly.] Thank you. [Koh wheels around Aang to look at him from behind. His voice is low and melodic, almost purring.]
You know me?
[Confused, yet seriously.] I didn't know that. Why did he, or I, try to kill you?
I need to find the moon and the ocean.
[Side-view of Aang.] Please. Help me find them. An entire culture could be destroyed if I don't get their help. [Top-down view of Koh who changes his face to that of an old man. Aang is visible below him.]
What do you mean? How can I find them and protect them?
[Excitedly.] The koi fish! [Hearing the emotion in Aang's voice, Koh quickly reels around to stare at the now expressionless face of Aang.] I must be going now.
The spirits are in trouble, I need to get back to the physical world.
[Aang turns around; excitedly.] Hei Bai!
This is where I came in, but how do I get back?
Momo! [Walking toward Momo. Closer view of Aang with Momo.] Momo. Oh no, where's my body?
[Cut to close-up of Aang as he narrows his eyes.] It's good to be back.
[On seeing Appa.] Appa!
We need to get to the oasis; the spirits are in trouble!
Wait, we can't just leave him here.
No, if we leave him he'll die.
[Cut to Aang. Holding his head with one hand.] I feel it, too. The Moon Spirit is in trouble.
[Cut to Aang and the others surrendering.] Zhao, don't!
[Close-up side-view of Aang.] Destroying the moon won't hurt just the Water Tribe. [Close-up panning shot of the sack with Tui inside and Zhao.] It will hurt everyone, including you. [Cut to panning shot of the oasis.] Without the moon, everything would fall out of balance. You have no idea what kind of chaos that would unleash on the world. [Cut to Zhao.]
[Close-up of Aang entering the Avatar State.] No, it's not over.
Come here.
Not if we can stop it!
[Frontal view of Toph, Sokka, and Aang.] Toph, let's make a trench to stop the fire from coming any closer.
[Slight pause, points at Momo.] Keep an eye on Momo.
Sokka, stand clear!
Good work, everybody.
These people have no idea [Closer side-view of the three.] how close they were to getting toasted last night.
Yeah, and who keeps us laughing with sarcastic comments all the time? [Frontal view of Katara and Aang.] I mean, look at Katara's hair, right? What's up with that?
[Realizing his mistake.] Nothing. I was just trying to ...
[Off-screen.] What do you think? [Cut to Aang as the camera pans up to see him wearing strange, scary armor.] Pretty slick, huh? [Close-up of Katara with a scared and surprised expression. Side-view of Katara approaching Aang, holding a hand up to avoid the glare coming off Aang's helmet.] All I need to complete the outfit is a wind sword.
It's where I get a sword handle and then I just swing this around and bend air out like a blade. [Raises a sword handle, swishing it around like a sword.] Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh.
I'll just stick to what I got.
[Side-view of group.] That's it! That's what you needed all along, Sokka.
Not the sword, a master. [Sokka takes the sword from the rack.] We've all had masters to help us get better. You should see if you can study with Piandao.
What should we do today‌?
Twice?
[Attempting to joke.] How hot is it?
I guess the jokes don't run in the family.
[Pointing at a different spot.] No, we're over on this island.
Sokka!
[Close-up as he steps back slightly.] Say something funny!
How did you know‌?
The White Lotus. Huh.
[Excitedly.] Wait 'til you see it, Katara! The Air Temple is one of the most beautiful places in the world!
[Smiling broadly.] That's why I'm so excited!
[Happily.] I know, but I need to see it for myself.
[Cheerfully.] Wake up, Sokka! Air Temple, here we come! [Sokka awakens, making groggy noises.]
[Alarmed.] Sokka! Wake up! [Aang moves the stick up and down the sleeping bag, only touching Sokka with the tip of it.] There's a prickle snake in your sleeping bag!
[Happily.] Great! You're awake! Let's go!
[Surprised.] Oh. That was food? [Happily.] I used it to start the campfire last night. [The hint of a smile can be heard.] Sorry.
[Excitedly.] The Patola Mountain range! We're almost there!
[Cheerfully.] What about 'em?
[Ponders over her words for a bit. Hopefully.] Just because no one has seen an airbender, doesn't mean the Fire Nation killed them all. They probably escaped!
[Cheerfully, as Katara moves her hand back to her side.] You don't understand, Katara. The only way to get to an airbender temple is on a flying bison, and I doubt the Fire Nation has any flying bison! [Caresses Appa's head.] Right, Appa?
Yip yip!
[Voice-over.] There it is. The Southern Air Temple.
[To Appa.] We're home, buddy! We're home. [His eyes squint a bit in happiness.]
[Excited.] So that's where my friends and I would play airball, [The camera shifts to a shot of a stadium consisting of many tall poles.] and over there [The camera pans to the right to reveal the trio again.] is where the bison would sleep, and ... [Aang sighs.]
[A bit saddened.] This place used to be full of monks and lemurs and bison. Now there's just a bunch of weeds. [His eyes squint with sadness. The shot changes to a back view of Aang as he stands on the ledge; his clothes flutter in the wind, a dead tree at each side of him. In a sad tone.] I can't believe how much things have changed.
[Smiling broadly, he stretches out his arms above his head.] Aang, seven! [He forms a Zero with his hands and makes a circular movement with his whole body.] Sokka, zero!
[Aang runs to them from the airball court, still playing with the hollow ball. Cheerfully.] Okay!
[Happily runs up.] What is it?
Nice one! But enough practicing, [Excited as he turns around and start walking away.] we have a whole temple to see!
[Happily.] Hey guys! [The two look up and see Aang standing in front of a statue of a monk, turning around and pointing toward it.] I want you to meet somebody!
[Facing the statue again.] Monk Gyatso! The greatest airbender in the world. [Scene switches to a frontal view of the statue as Aang turns around again toward the siblings while gesturing at the statue.] He taught me everything I know.
[Distant.] Hmm ...
[Downcast.] This whole Avatar thing, m-maybe the monks made a mistake.
[Voice-over.] But Gyatso? How do I know if I'm ready for this?
[Excited and curious.] Who is it?
[Happily stands up.] All right.
[Downcast.] Yeah. [He walks away.]
[Switch to a shot from Katara's point of view. Aang is walking up some stairs that lead to a corridor behind the statue. He looks back while answering.] The air temple sanctuary. There's someone I'm ready to meet.
[Camera changes to show the trio looking up at the door. Hopeful.] It's not impossible. [Opening his arms.] I survived in the iceberg for that long.
[Close shot of Aang with Katara visible over his shoulder. He glances hopeful at her over his shoulder. Excited.] Katara, whoever's in there might help figure out this Avatar thing!
[Shot from over Sokka's shoulder.] The key, Sokka, is airbending.
[Cut to a front view of Aang, as he brings his hand besides his mouth.] Hello? [Switch back to a shot from behind Sokka and Katara as Aang enters the sanctuary.] Anyone home?
[Pensive.] I'm not sure. [Frontal view of Aang.] But it feels like I know them somehow. Look! [Camera shifts to a point behind Aang and Katara. Aang points at the statue of a man with airbending mastery tattoos in front of him.] That one's an airbender.
That's the Avatar Cycle.
Wow! There are so many!
[Dazed.] Huh?
That's Avatar Roku. The Avatar before me.
I'm not sure. I just know it somehow.
[Excitedly.] Lemur!
[Reassuring.] Don't listen to him. You're going to be my new pet.
Wait! Come back!
[Follows the lemur.] Hey! Come back! [Cut to a shot from inside the tent, as Aang pushes the decaying curtain of drapes out of the way. Happily looks around.] Come on out, little lemur! That hungry guy won't bother you anymore.
[Shocked.] Firebenders? They were here?
[Devastated.] Gyatso.
[Sad and tired.] I'm sorry.
[Sadly.] But you were right. And if the firebenders found this temple, that means they found the other ones, too. [Close-up of his sad face, as he closes his eyes.] I really am the last airbender.
[Closer shot of Aang and Katara's faces. Softly.] How is Roku supposed to help me if I can't talk to him?
Looks like you made a new friend Sokka!
[Looking at the lemur from the corners of his eye.] Hey, little guy!
[To the winged-lemur.] You, me and Appa; [Frontal view as the camera closes in on them.] we're all that's left of this place. [Looks at the lemur.] We have to stick together. Katara, Sokka, [Switches to a shot of the duo fiddling with their luggage. They turn back to look at Aang as he calls them. Sokka is still eating a peach.] say hello to the newest member of our family.
Momo.
[To Zuko.] What are you doing?
[In the background, Sokka and Katara run up to him.] Zuko! No!
I can't get him to go in there! Appa hates tunnels!
We'll have to find a way!
We'll get through. Let's go.
Wow, camping ... it really seems like old times again, doesn't it?
[Jokingly.] Why? Is it your turn to take a little field trip with Zuko?
[Slightly surprised.] Oh. What's going on?
Um ... and what exactly do you think this will accomplish?
Wait! Stop! I do understand. You're feeling unbelievable pain and rage. How do think I felt about the sandbenders when they stole Appa? How do you think I felt about the Fire Nation when I found out what happened to my people?
I don't think so. I think it's about getting revenge.
Katara, you sound like Jet.
The monks used to say that revenge is like a two-headed rat viper. While you watch your enemy go down, you're being poisoned yourself.
Katara, you do have a choice: forgiveness.
No, it's not. It's easy to do nothing, but it's hard to forgive.
So you were just gonna take Appa anyway?
It's okay, because I forgive you. [Pauses.] That give you any ideas?
I wasn't planning to. This is a journey you need to take. You need to face this man. [Katara situates herself on Appa's head.] But when you do, please don't choose revenge. Let your anger out, and then let it go. Forgive him.
Thanks, Sokka.
I appreciate that.
[Surprised.] Why do you need Momo?
Katara? Are you okay?
Zuko told me what you did. Or what you didn't do, I guess. I'm proud of you.
You did the right thing. Forgiveness is the first step you have to take to begin healing.
It never is.
[Stops firebending and turns to Zuko while growling in irritance.] I'm trying.
[Brightens up upon hearing this.] Ooh, ooh! Me, me, me! [Runs to Katara.]
Check out my Appa sand sculpture. [Appa roars at the sculpture.]
[Amazed.] Whoa! Wow, you've even made a little Earth King and Bosco.
Is that a blubbering blob monster?
But it doesn't even look like- Aah!
[Peeking out from behind the sculpture fearfully.] What are you doing?
Get a grip before I blast you off this roof!
Enough!
About Sozin's Comet ... I was actually gonna wait to fight the Fire Lord until after it came.
I'm not ready. I need more time to master firebending.
What am I gonna do?
Why didn't you tell me about your dad's crazy plan sooner? [Walks away.]
[Holding his head with both hands.] This is bad. [Sinks down to his knees.] This is really, really bad.
Fighting the Fire Lord is going to be the hardest thing we've ever done together, but I wouldn't want to do it any other way.
That's like waterbending. [Joins Zuko in practicing the lightning redirection form.]
So, have you ever redirected lightning before?
What did it feel like?
[Chuckles.] Well, not over over. I mean there's always Katara and a little Spirit Water action, [Turns to Katara.] am I right?
[Disappointed.] Oh.
Yeah, I'll just do that.
[Shaking his head.] I can't.
I'm sorry, but it just didn't feel right. I didn't feel like myself.
[The camera pans to him.] But he's still a human being.
No, I agree with you. [Stands up.] Fire Lord Ozai is a horrible person, and the world would probably be better off without him, but there's got to be another way.
I don't know. [Perking up.] Maybe we can make some big pots of glue, and then I can use gluebending to stick his arms and legs together so he can't bend anymore.
[Excitedly.] Do you really think that would work?
[Sighs. Paces back and forth.] This goes against everything I learned from the monks. I can't just go around wiping out people I don't like.
[Turns back to Sokka; losing his temper.] This isn't a joke, Sokka! None of you understand the position I'm in.
Just what, Katara? What?
Then, when you figure out a way for me to beat the Fire Lord without taking his life, I'd love to hear it! [Walks away.]
[Stroking the lemur's head.] Hey, Momo. I don't suppose you know what I should do. [Momo squawks.] I didn't think so.
[Waking up.] Hey, Momo. I just had the strangest dream. [Looks around surprised at his new setting.] Wait. [The camera pans toward the ocean and shows an aerial shot of the island.] Where are we?
Where are we, Momo? [Cut to view of the sky through the trees as dragonflies fly past. The camera pans down as Aang speaks.] Maybe I'm in the Spirit World? [Cut to frontal view of Aang stepping under a branch.] But wait. You can see me. [Momo approaches on the branch. Cut to a close-up of Momo.] We could both be in the Spirit World. [Cut back to Aang. He uses airbending and the camera pans across as he moves.] Nope. My bending works. [Momo lands on him. Points to the hilltop. Cut to path up a hill. Camera pans up as Aang talks.] Maybe if we climb to the top of the island, we can figure out where we are.
It's a hexagon. [Cut to Aang's feet as Momo jumps off his shoulder. Bends down to place a hand on the ground.] It doesn't seem like normal rock. [Stands back up. Cut to a side-view as he attempts earthbending, but nothing happens.] It's not made of earth. [Sits down.] This is so strange. [Frontal view of Aang with Momo in the foreground, his back to the camera.] I wish I had some help right now. I wish I had Roku. [Suddenly realizes something.] I do have Roku! [Takes a deep breath and starts meditating. Fade to close-up of Aang. Cut to side-view as Momo runs off and the spirit of Avatar Roku appears before Aang.]
[Looking around.] So where am I, Roku? What is this place?
I am. I need to figure out what to do once I face the Fire Lord.
Everyone expects me to take the Fire Lord's life, [Side-view.] but I just don't know if I can do that.
Avatar Kyoshi. I need your wisdom.
[Voice-over; Side-view of Chin as he falls to his death.] You didn't really kill Chin. [Camera cuts back to close-up view looking up at Aang.] Technically, he fell to his own doom because he was too stubborn to get out of the way.
[Close-up. Disappointed. Side-view as he leans back.] I knew I shouldn't have asked Kyoshi.
I need to look deep inside myself.
[Voice-over.] All these past Avatars. [Cut to frontal view of Aang.] They keep telling me I'm gonna have to do it. They don't get it. [Momo chitters.] You're right. Maybe an Air Nomad Avatar will understand where I'm coming from. [Close-up of Momo, who stares at him. Frontal view of Aang as Momo jumps to his other side.] I know you can't really talk. Pretending you can just helps me think. [Momo chitters again; Aang becomes annoyed.] I'm going to pretend I didn't pretend to hear that.
Avatar Yangchen, [Close-up of Aang.] the monks always taught me that all life is sacred. Even the life of the tiniest spider-fly caught in its own web.
[Frontal view. Smiles.] I know, I'm even a vegetarian. I've always tried to solve my problems by being quick or clever. And I've only had to use violence for necessary defense. And I've certainly never used it to take a life.
But the monks taught me that I had to detach myself from the world so my spirit could be free.
[Momo appears behind a tree and approaches Aang. Close-up aerial view of Aang. Sorrowfully.] I guess I don't have a choice, Momo. [Camera zooms out as Aang looks up.] I have to kill the Fire Lord.
Wait. [Cut to view of "approaching" mountains.] Is it just me, or are those mountains getting bigger?
They're not getting larger, [Turning back. Excitedly.] They're getting closer! [Aang jumps off the tree. Cut to side-view as he runs toward the edge of the island, Momo in his wake.] The whole island is moving!
It's amazing Momo! The biggest animal in the world! I've gotta to swim around and find its face. [Momo chitters in response and he swims off toward the front of the "island". Momo follows him.]
[Side-view.] A lion turtle! [Frontal view. Bows to it. Frontal view of Lion turtle.] Maybe you can help me. Everyone, even my own past lives, are expecting me to end someone's life. [Frontal view.] But I don't know if I can do it.
Momo, time for you to go.
Please listen to me. We don't have to fight. You have the power to end it here and stop what you're doing.
Fire Lord Ozai, you and your forefathers have devastated the balance of this world, and now you shall pay the ultimate price! [Aang, under control of his past lives, combines all four elements together for his final attack. At the last second, however, he manages to regain control; he comes out of the Avatar State, lets his attack die out, and floats to the ground, freeing Ozai in the process.] No, I'm not gonna end it like this.
I took away your firebending. You can't use it to hurt or threaten anyone else ever again.
I learned there was another way to defeat him and restore balance. I took his bending away.
A giant lion turtle.
And now we're friends.
I can't believe a year ago I was still frozen in a block of ice. The world's so different now.
[Close-up as he is looking toward Katara; contentedly.] I need you, too.
[Alarmed.] Be careful, guys! [He looks to his left and right, uneasy.] Guys?
[Surprised.] Gyatso?
[Frontal shot; his voice soft and sad.] I didn't mean to.
[Shot looking down, sliding right; Aang turns to his friends.] It's nothing. I just had a bad dream. [He curls up, facing away from them.] Go back to sleep.
[Looking lost.] I'm okay.
[Briefly closing his eyes.] I think I just need some rest.
Look at those clear skies, buddy! [Pets Appa's head. Cut to a close shot as he looks up at a flock of birds arranged in a "V" flying overhead, their goose-like honking audible.] Should be some smooth flying.
[Taking a step toward Katara.] I think it's true, Katara. Swishing means it's ripe.
[Nervously suggesting to Katara and Sokka.] Maybe we should find some shelter?
Sokka, maybe this isn't such a good idea. Look at the sky.
[Quietly.] I'm sorry for running away.
Actually, he wasn't.
[Speaks in a sad voice.] I don't want to talk about it.
Well, it's kind of a long story.
I'll never forget the day the monks told me I was the Avatar. I was playing with some other kids just outside the South Wall. I was trying to teach them how to do the air scooter.
First you got to form the ball, then you got to get on quick.
You kind of have to balance on it like it's a top.
I made it up.
How do you know it's me?
Those were some of my favorite toys when I was little! [He picks up the propeller toy.]
I just chose them because they seemed fun.
Well, I didn't know how to feel about it. All I knew was that after I found out, everything began changing.
Hey, not bad! You guys have been practicing!
Great! [Aang is shown making his own. But everyone else makes theirs vanish.] What's going on?
But I'm still the same! Nothing's changed! So, what? I can't play?
Oh, okay.
What do you mean?
Hey!
Then, just when I was feeling better, something worse happened.
[Stands up.] How could they do that to me? They wanted to take away everything I knew and everyone I loved! [He activates the Avatar State.]
I'm sorry I got so mad.
Well, that's not exactly what happened. [Flashback starts again, showing Aang looking out the window of his bedroom.] I was afraid and confused. I didn't know what to do.
[Still in present, but flashback playing still.] I never saw Gyatso again. [Flashback shows Aang and Appa through the storm, and how Aang got into the iceberg.] Next thing I knew, I was waking up in your arms after you found me in the iceberg.
And then the Fire Nation attacked our temple. My people needed me and I wasn't there to help.
The world needed me and I wasn't there to help.
The fisherman was right! I did turn my back on the world!
You don't know that.
I'm going to find him!
We'll be back soon. I promise.
Come on, Appa! The boat! There!
Hang onto the rope.
He doesn't have to apologize.
Actually, I don't eat meat.
Katara, I think you were right before. I'm done dwelling on the past.
I can't make guesses about what would have turned out if I hadn't run away. I'm here now and I'm going to make the most out of it.
Appa!
[From off-camera.] What'd you say, brain boy? [The camera pans to Aang swamp skiing.] You love water? Yee-haw!
Not you.
[Confused.] What? I didn't even notice.
[He still seems somewhat dazed by the swamp.] I know this is going to sound weird, but I think the swamp is calling to me.
No, I ... I think it wants us to land there.
I don't know. Bumi said to learn earthbending I would have to wait and listen, and now I'm actually hearing the earth. Do you want me to ignore it?
[Resignedly.] Okay, since everyone feels so strongly about this, [Looks at swamp.] bye swamp. [Shakes Appa's rope.] Yip, Yip!
[Looking around the swamp and at his friends.] Where's Appa and Momo? [Aang jumps up to the top of the trees, looking for his animal friends as he uses the height to search for them.] Appa! Momo!
[Jumping down into the muddy water.] No, and the tornado ... it just disappeared.
[To Sokka.] Maybe we should be a little nicer to the swamp.
Sokka, the longer we're here, the more I think you shouldn't be doing do that.
Except for them.
Guys?
Katara! Appa!
Hello? Who are you?
Hey, come back! [He holds his hand out as though to grab her.]
Who are you?
[He looks away before airbending himself to his feet. He appears embarrassed that he was not actively searching for his friends like they were him.] I was chasing some girl.
[He walks over to Katara and helps her up before rubbing his ear.] I don't know. I heard laughing and I saw some girl in a fancy dress.
What about me? I didn't know the girl I saw. And all our visions led us right here.
Yeah, the center ... it's the heart of the swamp. It's been calling us here. I knew it.
[Demanding offensively.] Why did you call me here if you just wanted to kill us!?
[He shares a look of confusion with Sokka, who is also in an offensive stance.] We were flying over and I heard something calling to me, telling me to land.
[Cuts back to Aang, looking at Huu. He is still openly skeptical.] I get how the tree is one big thing, but the whole world?
But what about my vision? It was someone I had never met.
[He looks down as he tries to understand.] Time is an illusion. So, it's someone I will meet.
I think I know how to find them. [Aang kneels down and places his hand on the tree.] Everything is connected. [Energy travels from Aang's hand to Appa's location. Appa is seen being captured by the Foggy Swamp members. Back at the banyan-grove tree, Aang stands up.] Come on! We've got to hurry!
Appa!
[Feeding Momo.] But what about when the tree showed me where Appa and Momo were?
[Kneeling on one knee and holding his hand out.] Hey there, fellow. You look hungry.
[Looking at a cage.] What kinda animal is that? [They both stop walking.]
[Smiling.] Let's do it!
There's a big open space right outside the walls of the city.
Don't worry, I'm great with animals.
[He scratches his head.] This was so much easier in my head.
Well, Mr. Zookeeper, how do you like your new facilities?
[Frontal view.] Wahoo! Hang on, Momo.
Whoa!
[View from behind, from the saddle.] Doing it. [Side-view of Appa.] Appa, yip yip! [Appa flies down. Cut to a frontal view of Sokka and Kya screaming. Side-view of Appa as he manages to dodge the fireballs. Cut behind Appa he flies down to the water. Frontal view of Appa as he skims the water. The camera pans right to follow him glide over the top of the water. Cut to an underwater view of Appa. As a shadowed creature passes in front of the camera. Cut to a view from behind Aang, who turns to Kya and Sokka.] You guys having fun yet? [A huge sea serpent emerges from the water in front of the gang and the camera zooms out. Cut to a close-up of Aang, Sokka, Kya, and Momo, all screaming. Frontal view of Appa, who dodges the serpent and escapes its bite. Frontal view of Aang.] Not bad, huh? Let's do it again!
Looking good, Kya.
Keep it up.
I said keep it up.
Listen Kya. Here's the secret to bending. [Frontal view; standing.] Energy comes from the Earth, through your roots, and into your branches.
Use your legs. [Side-view of Aang from behind Kya. Aang turns his head slightly and the camera cuts to Sokka, readying his boomerang. Cut back to side-view of Aang from behind Kya as Aang turns his head to see what Sokka is looking at. Cut close-up a tree with bananas on it. The camera zooms out to show Sokka aiming for it. Side-view of Aang from behind Kya.] Watch closely.
Me?
[Close-up.] Oh uh, well, the Earth's bounty is rich, Sokka. There's got to be more food somewhere on this island. [Side-view of the two.]
Quick Kya, [Frontal view of Appa.] let's go swimming before Sokka gets back.
Me? I, uh, I was just watching you. You know, trying to learn your technique.
[Frontal view of the two.] Yep, it appears I taught you well. And thus the master passes the reins to the pupil. [Presents her with a flower and bows.] Ancient tradition. [Kya grabs the flower and giggles, before throwing the flower away. Momo perks his ears up as if he hears something.] What do you hear, Momo?
[Frontal view.] You're important, too ... to me.
Kya, [Frontal view.] remember it's all in the legs.
[Imitating Kya.] "You're the Avatar, start acting like it." [Frontal view of Aang.] If that's the case, shouldn't I be using my skills to help. [To Momo.] Exactly, I can't let anything happen to Kya and Sokka. They're the only family I have, besides you. [He moves the ball to right and the camera pans right slightly.] If I were about to be eaten by a pack of angry hog monkeys, you'd save me, right? Yeah, I thought so.
[Close-up.] And miss all the fun? Forget it.
[Frontal view.] What's the matter, Zuko? Can't handle me alone?
[Frontal view.] If you insist.
[Frontal view.] Oooh. Get him, Momo!
You sure about that?
[Side-view of Sokka and Momo, the latter still eating.] Good work, Sokka! You found the food. [Frontal view of Kya and Aang. Kya moans in fear.] Come on, Kya, you're flying with the Avatar, start acting like it. [Kya moans in fear again. Cut to an aerial view of the base as the group flies past.] Woohoo!
[Aang falls off Appa. Side-view of Appa as he falls.] Aaah! [Screen fades to black.] I meant to do that!
Well ... [Happily.] I know it's near water.
Momo, marbles please. [Close-up of Momo who dives into his shirt and emerges, handing Aang two small, gray marbles.] Hey Katara, check out this airbending trick!
[Disappointed, stops performing the trick.] You didn't even look.
[Dismayed.] But I'm not doing it now.
[Cut to a frontal view of Aang with the duo in the background. Enthusiastically.] Relax, Sokka. Where we're going, you won't need any pants.
[Camera moves back to reveal Appa as well. Innocently.] But Appa's tired, aren't you boy?
[Nudges Appa against his front leg with his elbow.] I said, aren't you boy?
[Runs toward the shore, takes a sharp breath and points. Excitedly.] Look!
[Excited.] That's why we're here. [Starts to disrobe while more koi fish jump out of the water in the background.] Elephant koi, and I'm gonna ride it. Katara, you've got to watch me!
Cold!
[Switch to a close-up of Aang atop the fish's back, waving at his friends.] Hahaha, hahaha!
[Disappointed, the smile having faded off his face.] Oh man ...
[Flailing his arms and legs.] Whaaaahh! Aaaah!
[Frightened.] Whaaaahh!
I don't know.
It's my fault. [The three teenagers looks surprised at Aang's words. The camera pans the left to reveal a sorrowfully looking Aang.] I'm sorry we came here. I wanted to ride the elephant koi.
[Cut back to Aang, a brightened expression on his face.] This island is named for Kyoshi? I know Kyoshi!
[Cut to Aang who looks pensive at the statue before looking at the ground in front of him. He speaks in a soft, calm voice while the camera slowly zooms in on him.] I know her because I'm the Avatar.
[Cut to Aang and his friend from a point of view between Suki and Oyaji. Aang smiles sheepishly.] That's me!
[Cut to a frontal view of Aang with a serious look on his face, a relieved Sokka and Katara still tied up in the background to his left.] Now ... [He pulls his marbles out from underneath his robes.] check this out!
[Throws his arms in the air while Momo digs in and chitters. Ecstatic.] All right! Dessert for breakfast!
These people sure know [The rest is kind of muffled out because he is cramming his desserts in his mouth.] how to treat an Avatar!
[Impressed.] Mmm ... [Offers one of the desserts he is holding to Katara.] Katara you've got to try these!
Sokka, what's your problem? Eat!
[Aang leans backward to be able to look past Katara to Sokka; his eyes wide open in surprise.] But you're always hungry!
What's he so angry about? [Excited.] It's great here. They're giving us the royal treatment!
[Lowers his arm with the pastry and offers it to Momo's grasping paw.] I'm sure we'll be fine. [The lemur feels the desert and quickly snatches it out of Aang's hand.] Besides, did you see how happy I'm making this town? [Aang moves closer to Katara and turns around to look out of the window at the statue.] They're even cleaning up that statue in my honor!
[Reassuring.] Come on, you know me better than that. I'm just a simple monk.
There she is, girls. Me in a past life.
[Holding up a finger to draw their attention.] Excuse me for a second, ladies.
[Holding up his hands to fob off with the offered pot.] Actually, I can't right now.
I promised the girls I'd give them a ride on Appa. Why don't you come with us? It'll be fun!
[Disappointed.] Well, neither does carrying your basket.
[Central focus on Aang.] I don't want to leave Kyoshi yet. I can't put my finger on it, [He puts his hand to his chin in a thinking posture; the camera pans to the right, showing Aang's fangirls better in the background.] but there's something I really like about this place.
[Enthusiastically.] Just a second, Koko!
It didn't. You know what I think? You just don't want to come because you're jealous.
Jealous that we're having so much fun without you.
It is a little ridiculous, but I understand.
[Popping in; smiling broadly.] Hey Sokka! [Sokka winces upon hearing his name and slants his eyes and shoulders in embarrassment.] Nice dress!
[Confidently.] Katara, remember how Unagi almost got me yesterday?
[Bragging.] Well, I'm gonna go ride it now. It's gonna be real dangerous.
[Surprised.] You're not going to stop me?
[Crossing his arms; defiant.] I will.
[Annoyed at Katara's lack of interest.] I know it's great.
[Annoyed.] I'm glad you're glad.
[Emphasizing his reacting by swinging his hands.] Fine!
[Close-up; reassuring.] I'm sure it will be here any second! [Looking for a way to entertain the girls.] What about this?
[Waving from the water to the girls. Pleading.] Where're you going? Don't leave!
[Happily.] Katara! You showed up!
Back there you acted like you didn't care.
[Lowering his eyes.] Me too. I did let all that attention go to my head. I was being a jerk.
[Smiling broadly and starts to swing toward the shore.] On my way!
[Coughing out the last of the water. In a weak voice.] Katara ... [Katara lovingly smiles at him with relief written all over her face.] don't ride Unagi. Not fun.
[Close-up of Zuko.] Hey! Over here!
[Sorrowful.] Look what I brought to this place.
[Close-up. Upset.] Yes, it is. These people got their town destroyed trying to protect me.
[Sad.] I'll call Appa.
[Pulling the reins.] Appa, yip yip!
[Side-view of Aang mounting Appa's saddle.] I know, I know. That was stupid and dangerous.
[Irritably.] I have an idea! Why don't we all get on your [Points angrily at Sokka; Katara briefly looks at Aang, but resumes her stare in front of her.] back and you could fly us to the North Pole?!
[Pointing excitedly.] There it is!
[To Katara.] We'll find a master to teach us, no problem.
My friend and I can't wait to start training with you! After we relax for a couple of days.
Good morning, Master Pakku!
Uhhh ... This is my friend, Katara. The one I told you about?
[Also just as angry.] Yeah, they're not fair! If you won't teach Katara, then ...
Then I won't learn from you!
I'm trying ...
That bad?
Master Poophead won't teach her because she's a girl.
[Bending up some water.] Master Pakku said this move is all about sinking and floating. [Sends the water to her.]
That was amazing!
I was just showing Katara a few moves.
I'm sorry, I ...
Uhhh ... Katara?
I'm sure she didn't mean that.
You don't have to do this for me. I can find another teacher.
Go, Katara!
[To Sokka.] Go get her.
Hey, Katara!
Good to see you here.
[Worriedly.] It's what Avatar Roku said. I'm supposed to master all four elements before that comet arrives.
[Frightfully.] I haven't even started waterbending and we're still weeks away from the North Pole. What am I gonna do?
[Smiling.] You'd do that?
[Takes off his shirt, smiling.] Yeah! Don't start without me, boy! [Begins to run toward the water.]
[Stops short and looks at Katara.] Oh right. Time to practice waterbending. [Puts his clothes back on.]
You could ... clean the gunk out of Appa's toes. [Hands Sokka a branch with a bushel of leaves at the end.]
[Smiles; somewhat cheerfully.] Mud and bugs!
[Stands up.] Like this? [Does the hand movements Katara is doing, but nothing is happening yet.]
Hey, I'm bending it already! [Shows Aang making much bigger waves than Katara's on his first try.]
[Shrugs shoulders.] Well, you had to figure it all on your own. I'm lucky enough to have a great teacher.
So, what's next?
Sorry. [Excited.] Well, don't stop now! Keep 'em coming!
So, like this? [He raises his hands and creates a massive wave that towers over their heads.]
[Smiling.] Looks like I got the hang of that move! What else do you got?
[Looking guilty.] Uh, sorry. [Smiles worriedly.] I'm sure we can find somewhere to replace all this stuff.
Uh, make that two copper pieces, Sokka. I couldn't say no to this whistle! [Pulls out a white whistle that looks like a bison, takes a huge breath and blows into it, but it barely makes a sound.]
[Walks back to the man.] Sure! What are curios?
[Looks up close at an item on a shelf, confused.] Huh?
[Grabbing Momo.] Momo's not for sale.
[Turns to the captain, excited.] Where did you get a waterbending scroll?
[Turns around and whispers to Katara.] I know how to deal with these guys, Katara. Pirates love to haggle. [Katara drops the final coins in his hand.] Watch and learn. [Walks over to the counter, leans against it, and talks in a pirate voice.] Let's say to the price of, one copper piece! [Smiles, and dramatically presents the single coin.]
[Still smirking and talking like a pirate.] Okay, two copper pieces!
Aye, we be casting off now! [Walks away.]
What was that all about, Katara?
[Calmly turns around.] Well, well. Look who's come to their senses. Told you the haggling would pay off.
No thanks. [Spins and hurls a blast of air at the pirates that send them backward, and runs toward them with his glider out.] Grab on tight!
Just hang on! [Flies over the pirates' heads and into the distance.]
[Putting his glider away.] I used to kind of look up to pirates, but those guys are terrible.
[Surprised.] No way!
[Laughs.] Good one, Katara.
Well, what's done is done. We have it, we might as well learn from it.
You'll get it. [Katara glares at him.] You just gotta shift your weight through the stances. [He tries and does it perfectly on the first try.] There, see, the key to bending is—
It's okay Katara.
[Yawns.] What's wrong?
No Katara, it isn't.
Yeah, Sokka, you really should shut your mouth.
I'm over here! Follow my voice!
I'm right here! [Airbends the dust away, revealing the pirates surrounding him, and immediately airbends it back around himself.] Never mind! I'll find you! [Sokka climbs out of the dust cloud on his hands and knees. Aang vaults over him in a full sprint.] Run! [They find Katara, who is trying to push the pirate boat back into the water.] Katara, you're okay!
A team of rhinos, or two waterbenders.
Sokka, can't you make it go any faster?
Hey, you did the water whip!
Oh no ...
[Holding up the whistle.] I knew a bison whistle would come in handy! Thanks Appa.
That's okay Katara.
[Laughing.] Good one, Katara.
[He pets Appa, smiling slightly.] Sorry guys, but Appa gets tired carrying all these people.
No, she's right. We are here!
Why can't I go?
[Sitting down.] Fair enough. So, what's the new plan?
[Sarcastically.] Oh, yeah. That's great, no problem. I'll just do that.
Well, it's not even gonna be possible! Where am I supposed to get a firebending teacher?
[Shooting her idea down.] Yeah ... right. [He lays down on the bench without a care.] Like we'll ever run into Jeong Jeong again.
Oh well, guess we can't come up with anybody. Why don't we just take a nice tour around the temple? [He and Momo fly off.]
What? The wind is too loud in my ears! Check out this loop!
Okay, we can do that while I show you the giant Pai Sho table! Oh, you're gonna love the all-day echo chamber!
There's no way we can trust you after everything you've done. We'll never let you join us.
I kind of have a confession to make. Remember when you two were sick and I got captured by Zhao?
Anyway, when Zhao had me chained up, it was Zuko who came in and got me out. He risked his life to save me.
You're probably right.
Or when he tried to capture me at the Fire Temple!
I'm not having Zuko as my teacher!
You what?
But he did firebend at you?
I hate to go looking for a fight, but you're right. After what he did to Toph, I don't think we have a choice.
I can't believe I'm saying this, but ... thanks, Zuko.
[Looks at Zuko shocked, hearing these words, and thinks for a moment.] I think you are supposed to be my firebending teacher. When I first tried to learn firebending, I burned Katara, and after that, I never wanted to firebend again. But now I know you understand how easy it is to hurt the people you love. I'd like you to teach me. [Bows before Zuko.]
Not so fast. I still have to ask my friends if it's okay with them. [To Toph.] Toph, you're the one that Zuko burned. What do you think?
[Turning to Sokka.] Sokka?
[Approaching Katara.] Katara?
[Frontal shot; excitedly.] I'll try it! [Carrying his staff, he jumps off Appa with a big smile on his face. As he begins to fall, he turns once around his axis, winking at the camera as he passes. He falls down spreadeagled, laughing joyously.] Yeah!
[Looking at himself.] Turns out, clouds are made of water.
[Kneels down and sighs. He picks up some ash as it slowly seeps through his hand and drops to the ground; sadly.] Why would anyone do this? How could I let this happen?
[Sadly.] Yes, it does. It's the Avatar's job to protect nature. But I don't know how to do my job.
Yeah. A waterbending teacher. But there's no one who can teach me how to be the Avatar. Monk Gyatso said that Avatar Roku would help me.
I don't know. [Momo comes up to Aang and settles in his lap.]
[Sadly.] No. [An acorn is thrown at him.] Ow! Hey, how is that cheering me up?
Thanks, Katara.
Nice to meet you too! So ... is there something I can help you with?
So, what do you want me to do, exactly?
Right ... that's me.
Yeah, that might be because I don't know anything at all about the Spirit World. It's not like there's someone to teach me this stuff!
I have to try, don't I? Maybe whatever I have to do will just ... come to me. [Momo lands on his shoulder.]
[Walking toward the village entrance.] Hello, Spirit? Can you hear me? This is the Avatar speaking. I'm here to try to help stuff.
The sun has set. Where are you, Hei Bai? Well ... spirit ... uhhh ... I hereby ask you to please leave this village in peace. [He spins his staff and sticks it down, in apparent authority.] Okay ... well ... I guess that's settled, then.
You must be the Hei Bai spirit. My name is–
My name's Aang! I'm the Avatar and I would like to help. Hey, wait up! [Hei Bai wreaks havoc, smashing buildings and destroying a tower with energy.] Uhhh.
Please, would you stop destroying things and listen? I'm trying to do my job as spirit bridge! Excuse me, would please turn around? I command you to turn around now!
Sokka, go back!
I don't want to fight him unless I– [Sokka is taken by the Hei Bai, and the spirit flees. Aang chases it.]
Hang on, Sokka!
Sokka! [He realizes Sokka is nowhere to be seen.] I failed.
Katara? Katara, I lost him.
[His appearance is blue.] What? No, I'm right here! [He waves his hand in the Wanderer's face, only to notice his own appearance.] I'm in the Spirit World!
I'll figure this out, Katara. I promise. Like they said, I'm the bridge between the worlds, right? All I have to do is ... figure out what I have to do. But once I do that, no problem. [Appa approaches.] Appa! Hey buddy, I'm right here! [He breathes on Katara.] But, I guess you can't see me either.
What am I supposed to do? Avatar Roku, how can I talk to you? [He hears something.] Sokka? [He notices a dragon coming toward him.] That's definitely not Sokka. [He tries to fly away but cannot. He notices his airbending is not working at all.] What? I can't airbend in the Spirit World. [The dragon lands just before him.] You don't know where Sokka is, do you? [The dragon touches him. He sees a vision of Roku flying on this dragon.] You're Avatar Roku's animal guide! Like Appa is to me! I need to save my friend and I don't know how! Is there some way for me to talk to Roku? [The dragon curls around him, and he gets on him.] I'll be back, Katara. [It gets up.] Take me to Roku! [The dragon flies away.]
Hey, what are you doing? [He screams, but they fly right through the roof and into a mysterious room. Within is a celestial calendar and a statue of Roku.] I don't understand, this is just a statue of Roku. [Fang presses one of his feelers to Aang's forehead. A vision of a comet appears to him.] Is that what Roku wants to talk to me about? A comet? When can I talk to him? [Fang moves his head, allowing a light beam to appear. This is just to the right of Roku's statue. With another feeler press, he sees a vision of the sun setting and rising repeatedly, and the light closing in on Roku.] It's a calendar, and the light will reach Roku on the solstice! So, that's when I'll be able to speak to Roku? [The dragon breathes an apparent yes.] But I can't wait that long! I need to save Sokka now! [The dragon takes Aang from the temple.]
I'm not sure ...
You're the spirit of this forest! Now I understand. You're upset and angry because your home was burned down. When I saw the forest had burned, I was sad and upset, but my friend gave me hope that the forest would grow back. [He shows it the acorn and leaves it at his feet. The spirit picks it up and reverts to the panda form. It walks away peacefully. As it exits, a series of branches grow, and three villagers and Sokka emerge from it.]
Actually, I did have a little help and there's something else.
I need to talk to Roku and I think I found a way to contact his spirit.
There's a temple on a crescent-shaped island and if I go there on the solstice, I'll be able to speak with him.
Yeah, and there's one more problem. The island is in the Fire Nation.
[Strained voice.] Let's go, Appa! Come on, boy! [Appa roars in protest and sits down. Cut to a close side-view; Aang sadly addresses his pet.] Look I'm sorry, but Katara and Sokka aren't coming to the Fire Nation with us. [Frontal shot; looks down and away, sadly.] If they got hurt, I'd never forgive myself. [Cut back to the side-shot; sternly, emphasizing his command by straightening himself.] So get your big butt off the ground and let's go!
[Looks away sadly and recalls an image of Sozin's Comet.] But I have to talk to Avatar Roku to find out what my vision means! [Side-shot as he approaches his friends.] I need to get to the Fire Temple before the sun sets on the solstice. That's today!
Thank you for your-
Come on boy, we've got a long way to go. Faster!
I'm on it!
Yeah. But there's just one little problem.
If we fly north, we can go around the Fire Nation ships and avoid the blockade! It's the only way.
This is exactly why I didn't want you to come! It's too dangerous!
Appa, yip-yip! [Appa roars readily, sailing forward even quicker.]
Appa, are you okay? [Appa roars a reply. They soar higher into the clouds.]
[Cries out desperately.] Sokka! [Whips the reins down and begins a speedy descent in chase of Sokka.]
[Ecstatic.] We made it!
[Close-up. Momo is shown bouncing about in eager surprise.] There it is! [Sokka and Katara pop up in the saddle.] The island where Roku's dragon took me. [Full view of Crescent Island and its smoking volcano as Appa descends.]
[Rubs against Appa's head.] You did it buddy. Nice flying. [Appa bellows in satisfaction, rolling to his side to wave his three legs into the air lazily. Appa's tongue lolls out.]
It's almost sundown. We better hurry! [The group leaps over the wall and charges for the front door.]
Great! I am the Avatar!
[Deflects three balls of fire with his airbending. Close-up. Shouts over his shoulder.] I'll hold them off. Run!
[Hallway view; Aang skids in front of Katara and Sokka and continues running.] Follow me!
[Rounds a corner and disappears from sight.] Nope! [A moment passes, Katara and Sokka stop when Aang skids into view again. Fearfully.] Wrong way! [Runs past them.]
[Surprised.] You do?
[Skeptically.] How?
Did you know Avatar Roku?
Is that how you knew I was coming?
If this is the Avatar's temple, why did the sages attack me?
[Looking down, guiltily.] They were waiting for me.
Thank you for helping me. [Close-up as Shyu smiles to Aang.]
[Approaches door.] Shyu, what's wrong?
Definitely.
[Surprised.] They're still locked!
[Time skip. Everyone stands in front of the door. Aang beats upon it furiously with consecutive airbending slices.] Why, won't, it, open?!
[Glumly.] I'm sorry I put you through all of this for nothing.
[Confused.] Wait. How is Sokka a genius? His plan didn't even work.
[Dubiously.] Did the definition of genius change over the last hundred years? [Katara grasps her chin, slyly grinning toward Aang.]
[Stands. Confused.] The light hits the statue and I talk to Roku. So why isn't anything happening?
[Exasperated. Standing in the middle of the room, facing the statue.] Why isn't anything happening? I don't know what I'm doing! All I know is airbending! Please Avatar Roku, talk to me!
[Interested, curious.] Is it about that vision? The one of the comet?
What does it mean?
[Close-up.] So the comet made them stronger?
[Close-up.] But that happened a hundred years ago. What does the comet have to do with the War now?
[Counters anxiously.] But I haven't even started learning waterbending! Not to mention earth and fire!
[Terrified.] What if I can't master all the elements in time? What if I fail?
But I won't be able to come back to the temple. What if I have questions? How will I talk to you?
[Eyes and arrows glow.] I'm ready.
[Weakly.] Thanks. Where's Shyu?
