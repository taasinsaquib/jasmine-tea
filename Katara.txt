Confused. But, there's nothing here.
Do they have bathrooms in the Spirit World?
You mean, after all Roku and Sozin went through together, even after Roku showed him mercy, Sozin betrayed him like that‌?
Annoyed. Oh, Sokka, just hold hands.
My scrolls!
Grabbing Sokka's arm. There's no time!
Cheerfully. That's correct!
I hope that's okay.
Pointing at the float. Look! They made a giant Kyoshi float!
Pointing at a giant float of Aang coming down the street. Aang, look!
Surprised. Hey, what's that guy doing?
Why not? Aang helps people.
Katara places her arms on Aang's shoulders and starts to defend him. Aang would never do something like that. No Avatar would. Shaking her head in disapproval before pointing an accusing finger at the villagers. And it's not fair for you all to question his honor!
Slightly mocking. I think what "Master Swish" is trying to say Serious tone as she looks at Aang. is that you're supposed to be out saving the world. You can't do that locked up in here.
Aiding Aang by playing Sokka's ego. Yeah! Back home, he was famous for solving the mystery of the missing seal jerky.
Excitedly drawing her conclusions. So if they were built at the same time, that means–
That's a big hole in the mayor's story, Disappointed. but it's not enough to prove Aang's innocence.
Surprised. Where did you get that?
Gently breaks the news to Koko. He couldn't be here, Koko.
Oyaji! Aang is in jail. The town of Chin says he murdered their leader in a past life.
Approvingly. She had exquisite taste.
Squatting beside a really big pair of brown boots. These were her boots? Her feet must have been enormous!
Realizing something. Wait a minute ... big feet? A flashback shows the much smaller footprint they saw at the edge of the cliff outside Chin Village. Little footprint? She happily exclaims her findings. There's no way–
Sarcastically. You're right. I'm sorry. She bows slightly in a mocking gesture. Please.
Unimpressed. Brilliant, Sokka. Rolls her eyes.
They point east. So the sun must have been in the west.
Honorable Mayor, we've prepared a solid defense for the Avatar. We did an investigation and found some very strong evidence.
Mayor Tong, I'd like for the court to hear one last testimony.
This isn't just any witness. I'm going to call ... Spreads her arms. Avatar Kyoshi herself!
Hopeful. Well, she is Aang's past life. Maybe wearing her stuff will trigger something.
Pleading. Please! If you could just wait one more second, I'm sure Kyoshi will be here!
Awkwardly. Uhhh ... you kind of confessed. Sorry.
Begging. Community service! Please stop on community service!
Happy Avatar Day, everyone!
Water. Earth. Fire. Air. Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them, but when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar, an airbender named Aang. And although his airbending skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. But I believe Aang can save the world.
Protesting. Aang didn't do anything! It was an accident.
Irritably, clenching her fists. Sokka, you're making a mistake.
Angrily. Aang is not our enemy! Continues in a calm, soothing voice. Don't you see? Aang's brought us something we haven't had in a long time: fun.
Pleading. Grandmother, please. Don't let Sokka do this!
Outraged. Fine! Then I'm banished, too! Drags Aang away. Come on Aang, let's go.
Angrily. To find a waterbender. Aang is taking me to the North Pole.
Upset. So, you're leaving the South Pole? In a quieter tone. This is goodbye?
Still in that quiet tone. Where will you go?
Rounding on Kanna and interrupting her, her voice full of empassioned rage. You happy now? Gestures in the direction Aang took off. There goes my one chance at becoming a waterbender!
Hysterically. Sokka, get out of the way!
Surprised. Aang?
Sadly. No! Aang, don't do this!
Sokka is seen in the background, carrying a pack as she speaks on a determined tone. We have to go after that ship, Sokka. Aang saved our tribe, now we have to save him.
Making arm gestures to emphasize her words while she speaks in an objective tone. Why can't you realize that he's on our side? Cuts to shot of her and her brother, her back to the screen. If we don't help him, no one will. I know you don't like Aang, but we owe him and --
Running over to her brother. Sokka! She gives him a hug.
Annoyed. He's not my --
Pointing at the ready canoe. There's no way we're going to catch a warship with a canoe.
Brightly. Appa! Begins running toward the bison.
Pleading as Appa growls again. Please, Appa. We need your help. Aang needs your help.
Sokka doesn't believe you can fly, but I do, Appa. Strokes Appa. Come on, don't you want to save Aang? Appa grunts.
Thrilled. You did it, Sokka!
Horrified. Aang! No!
Voice-over. Aang! Aang! Aang!
Shocked. Did you see what he just did?!
Worried. Aang! Are you okay?
Urgently. Hurry up, Sokka!
Bewildered. How did you do that?! With the water? It was the most amazing thing I've ever seen!
Curious, but serious. Why didn't you tell us you were the Avatar?
But Aang, the world's been waiting for the Avatar to return and finally put an end to this war.
According to legend, you need to first master water, then earth, then fire, right?
Brightening a bit. Well, if we go to the North Pole, you can master waterbending!
Faces her brother; cheerfully. And Sokka, I'm sure you'll get to knock some firebender heads on the way.
Optimistically. Then we're in this together!
Curiously. What's there? Points to one of the locations.
Confused. Aang ...
Do you want to talk about it?
Accepts amulet and hugs Pakku. Thank you, Master Pakku.
As they fly away. Say hi to Gran-Gran for me!
Pleased. Mighty Katara? I like that.
Holds out her hand in reasoning. Aang still needs to master all four elements.
The group rises; angrily. No, nothing's decided. We already have a plan. Aang's pursuing his destiny his way.
Sits up. Aang, no! This is not the right way!
There's a right way to do this. Practice, study, and discipline!
Rises and throws her hands up in surrender. If you two meat heads want to throw away everything we've worked for, fine, go ahead and glow it up! Exits.
Can we talk about something?
Cuts to side-shot of Aang and Katara. Do you remember when we were at the air temple and you found Monk Gyatso's skeleton? It must have been so horrible and traumatic for you. I saw you get so upset that you weren't even you anymore. Closes up to Katara. I'm not saying the Avatar State doesn't have incredible and helpful power ... but you have to understand ... for the people who love you, watching you be in that much rage and pain is really scary.
Upset. I don't understand.
Sadly. I can't watch you do this to yourself. I'm not coming tomorrow. Begins to exit. Good night.
I wonder what crazy thing they're trying to do now. Momo, who is sleeping on a pillow, raises his head before going back to sleep. Katara hears another rumble outside and grows worried. Maybe we should just make sure Aang's okay.
Frantically. What's going on?
Struggling to break free. I can't move!
Frantically. Aang, I'm sinking! Twists around again and is buried chest deep.
Desperately. Please!
Casts the group a look of annoyance. I think we're all set.
Aang, you're awake! The two race over to him.
Hugs Aang. You're not dreaming. You're finally awake.
You need to take it easy, okay? You got hurt pretty bad. Smiling at him. I like your hair.
A few weeks.
Looking away, annoyed. Annoyed tone. We're fine, Dad.
Placing her hands on Aang's shoulders stopping him. He knows who you are. I just called you "Dad", didn't I?
Great, great, so now you guys have finally met. So would you mind giving us a little privacy?
Confused look. What, not at all. Why would you say that?
Maybe we should go upstairs. Helping Aang up. You need a healing session.
Tell me where the pain feels most intense.
I can feel a lot of energy twisted up around there. Begins to remove the water. Let me just see if I can-
I just used the spirit water from the North Pole. I don't know what I did exactly.
Placing a hand on the side of his face. You need to rest.
Sharply. It's Sokka's invasion plan.
Approaching Aang. Aang, wait! Remember, they don't know we're not Fire Nation!
During flashback. This is water from the spirit oasis at the north pole. It has special properties so I've been saving it for something important.
I'm gonna give us some cover!
Placing a hand on Sokka's shoulder. You guys go ahead without us. We'll catch up to you. Toph and Sokka exit. Katara sits on Aang's bed, placing a hand on his shoulder. I think I understand why being a secret bothers you so much. You don't want people to think you failed.
Aang, that's not true.
It's not for good. Getting up too. Remember, there's still a plan. The invasion!
Moving to comfort him. Aang ...
Exiting. Is there anything you need?
I brought you some food! Notices Aang has gone missing. Oh no ... Drops the food tray and runs.
He left.
Aang. He just took his glider and disappeared. He has this ridiculous notion that he has to save the world alone, that it's all his responsibility.
It's not brave, it's selfish and stupid! We could be helping him and I know the world needs him, but doesn't he know how much we need him, too? How can he just leave us behind?
How could you leave us, Dad? She attempts to wipe away the tears. I mean, I know we had Gran-Gran, and she loved us, but we were just so lost without you.
Embraces Hakoda. I understand why you left. I really do, and I know that you had to go, so why do I still feel this way? I'm so sad and angry and hurt!
You're okay!
I know, but you'll have our help.
Curiously. Did someone lose something?
Pointing at something in the distance. Wait, look! Cut to shot of a Water Tribe ship, half obscured behind large rocks, sitting idly on the shore.
Is this dad's boat? She and Sokka run toward it. Cut to shot of entire ship as they approach.
Cheerfully. Bato!
Is he here?
Bato, it looks like home! Bato, Katara, Sokka, and Aang file inside.
Surprised and delighted. No way! Stewed sea prunes!
Bato, is it true that you and dad lassoed an arctic hippo?
Everyone does!
To Bato. You and Dad had so many hilarious adventures.
Excited. Really?
I do really miss him, it would be great to see Dad. Aang gets up to leave, but no one notices him.
Even if we do have time to wait for the message, who knows how far we'd have to travel. We don't have time for a long detour.
Turns to face him. Hey, Aang, I didn't notice you left.
He never got to go. Dad left before he was old enough.
There's no way through!
Of course you can!
Concerned. Aang, what are you talking about?
Turns to look at Aang and closes her eyes. I'm with you Sokka.
Good luck.
To Sokka. That wolf sounds so sad.
Sokka?
Smiles. You're right.
Looks up. Aang!
We're getting you to the North Pole.
And we need you.
I'll be okay.
Takes the necklace. Aang, how'd you get that?
Aw, that's so sweet of Zuko. Could you give him a kiss for me when you see him?
So, how long do you think it's been since someone was here?
Close-up of Katara; disappointed. Oh. She looks down, saddened. So dad's probably long gone.
Shot of Katara and Aang around the campfire. It's okay Aang. Our dad left about two years ago, with all the other Water Tribe men.
Turns to Toph. There are walls all around us. It's completely safe.
Sitting up and looking back. I don't think so. I get the feeling he knows who we are.
Annoyed. Yeah, nothing except for water. Cut to Katara's water skin as she flicks its lid out. Cut to Katara's face. Everyone knows that water is the best element in the world!
She pushes Aang, causing him to go flying behind, and she yells. You think earth is better?
Blushing. Tiny Zuko! You look so cute!
Aang bows slightly to Toph; disappointed and tiredly. Hey, you never called me Sifu Katara.
I don't understand what went wrong. He did it exactly the way you did.
Trying to help Toph teach. I've been training Aang for a while now. He really responds well to a positive teaching experience. Lots of encouragement and praise. Kind words. If he's doing something wrong, maybe a gentle nudge in the right direction.
Sorry Toph, but are you really sure this is the way to teach Aang earthbending?
Nervously. Heh.
Aang, it's no big deal. You'll take a break and try earthbending again when you're ready. Besides, you still have a lot of waterbending to work on. Okay?
You know this block you're having is only temporary, right?
You do realize that's the problem, don't you? If you face this issue instead of avoiding it–
Aang, if fire and water are opposites, then what's the opposite of air?
That's why it's so difficult for you to get this. You're working with your natural opposite. But you'll figure it out. I know you will. Think fast! Throws a piece of reed at him, but Aang slices it in half with waterbending. Excellent. You have the reflexes of a waterbending master.
Hey Aang, have you seen–
It's important. It's almost sundown and Sokka isn't back yet. I think we should search for him.
You found him! Embraces Sokka.
You did it! I knew you would! Whispering to Toph. You tried the positive reinforcement, didn't you?
Then you should get it, you deserve something nice.
All right, then don't.
Who knows? This Master Yu could be the earthbending teacher you've been looking for.
Consolingly to Aang. I'll take care of this. To the students. Hey, strong guys! Wait up! Runs after the students around a corner.
You ready to find an earthbending teacher? Because we're going to Earth Rumble VI!
Oh ... a girl has her ways. Smiles.
Sighs and looks the other way. This is just going to be a bunch of guys chucking rocks at each other, isn't it?
Looking at The Boulder. How about The Boulder? He's got some good moves.
She can't really be blind. Turn her head and squints her eyes skeptically. It's just part of her Cut to a close-up of the Bandit's milky-green eyes; pans right. character, right?
How did she do that?
Slaps Sokka. Don't boo at him!
Sarcastically. That is a big relief.
Glares at them, causing them to back off. Yeah, I didn't think so.
Lays hands on Aang's shoulder. Let me handle this. Approaches the second student with a stern look; says accusingly. You're not telling us everything!
Hey, I got my eye on you.
You're the one whose bag matches his belt.
Cutting off Aang. What Aang is trying to say is, he's the Avatar. And if he doesn't master earthbending soon, he won't be able to defeat the Fire Lord.
"If you want to see your daughter again, bring five hundred gold pieces to the arena." It's signed Xin Fu and The Boulder.
We're going with you.
What about Aang?
Toph, there's too many of them. We need an earthbender. We need you!
Don't worry, we'll find you a teacher. There are plenty of amazing earthbenders out there.
Pressing a wet rag onto Sokka's forehead. This should bring your fever down.
That's nice. I'll tell him.
Not so good, being out in that storm really did a number on him.
Aang, he's in no condition for travel. Sokka just needs more rest. I'm sure he'll be better by tomorrow. Starts coughing.
Relax, it was just a little cough. I'm fi- She coughs again, this time with greater force, and lightly groans after.
Also weak. Listen carefully, Momo. Holds up a water skin. I need you to take this to the river, and fill it with water. She is shown through Momo's eyes, speaking gibberish. Got it? Momo takes the skin and flies off.
Weakly. Momo should be back any minute.
Weakly; in disgust. Ugh! No, Momo, water. Wa-ter! Momo's ear go straight up. He jumps off her and scampers. Aang, what in the world is taking you so long?
With a weak, sickly voice. How many times do I have to tell you, Momo? We need water, wa-ter. Oh forget it. Aang, please, hurry.
Sure. Cut to an overhead of the group sitting around a fire.
Right ... maybe that's because he remembers the whole thing.
"Need meat. Gone fishing. Back in a few days. Sokka and Zuko." As she says this, Aang yawns and turns around to lie back down. One more thing. "Aang, practice your firebending while I'm gone. Do twenty sets of fire fists and ten hot squats every time you hear a badgerfrog croak. Zuko."
What are you doing in this thing? What happened to the war balloon?
Tearing up; overjoyed. Dad? Runs to him.
How are you here? What is going on? Where did you go?
Water. Earth. Fire. Air. My grandmother used to tell me stories about the old days: a time of peace when the Avatar kept balance between the Water Tribes, Earth Kingdom, Fire Nation and Air Nomads. But that all changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar mastered all four elements; only he could stop the ruthless firebenders. But when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years have passed, and the Fire Nation is nearing victory in the war. Two years ago, my father and the men of my tribe journeyed to the Earth Kingdom to help fight against the Fire Nation, leaving me and my brother to look after our tribe. Some people believe that the Avatar was never reborn into the Air Nomads and that the cycle is broken, but I haven't lost hope. I still believe that, somehow, the Avatar will return to save the world.
Happily surprised. Sokka, look!
Struggling with the water that passes right in front of her. But, Sokka! I caught one!
Exclaims indignantly. Hey!
Cut to her face; she sighs lightly before answering in slight annoyance. It's not "magic", it's waterbending! And it's ...
Cut to her face as she raises an eyebrow skeptically, arms still crossed. You're calling me weird? I'm not the one who makes muscles at myself every time I see my reflection in the water!
Watch out! Go left! Go left!
A touch of bitterness in her voice. You call that left?
Indignantly. So it's my fault?
You are the most sexist, She brings her hands up to her head and swings them back down and behind her in her rage; the movement creates a small wave of water behind her. immature, Hands raised back to her head. nut brained ... Swings her arms back down again, creating a slightly larger wave; she raises her hands back to her head during a brief loss for words. I'm embarrassed Throwing a hand upward, a short jet of water shoots upward as well. to be related to you!
Ever since mom died, Points to herself. I've been doing all the work around camp while you've been off playing soldier!
Close-up of a rage-fueled Katara as she continues her outburst, a finger pointed in Sokka's face. I even wash all the clothes! Have you ever smelled your dirty socks? Let me tell you, not pleasant!
No that's it! I'm done helping you! From now on, you're on your own!
Astonished. You mean I did that?
He's alive! We have to help!
Waves the spear away. Annoyed. Stop it!
What?
Curiously. What is it?
Awkwardly. Uh, sure ... I-I guess.
Pushes Sokka's spear away again and addresses him sarcastically. Oh yeah, I'm sure he's a spy for the Fire Navy. You can tell by that evil look in his eye. Aang shoots the two an earnest grin. The paranoid one is my brother, Sokka. You never told us your name.
Gasps for air in comprehension. You're an airbender!
We'd love a ride! Thanks! Katara runs to the side of the bison.
While climbing on top of Appa with the help of Aang. Are you hoping some other kind of monster will come along and give you a ride home? You know, before you freeze to death?
Uncomfortably. Why are you smiling at me like that?
Hey.
I guess I was wondering, your being an airbender and all, if you had any idea what happened to the Avatar?
Okay. Just curious. She slants her eyes in disappointment for a second before smiling again at Aang. Good night.
Aang? Aang! Wake up. Aang shoots up, throwing the covers of his body and gasping for air. Katara perches beside him and stands up as she sees that Aang is awake. It's okay, we're in the village now! Come on, get ready. She points to the door of the tent. Everyone's waiting to meet you.
Aang, this is the entire village. Points to the line of villagers in front of them. Entire village, Aang.
Gesturing. Aang, this is my grandmother.
Offering her hand to pull him out of the snow. That was amazing!
Nervously. Well, sort of. Not yet.
Excitedly. I told you, he's the real thing Gran-Gran! I finally found a bender to teach me!
But he's special! I can tell! Clenches her fist and closes her eyes in hope. I sense he's filled with much wisdom.
Runs up to Sokka as the children leave. In a worried tone. Have you seen Aang? Gran-Gran said he disappeared over an hour ago.
Aang?
Amused. Hehehe, Aang, I'll help you catch a penguin if you teach me waterbending.
Sadly. No. You're looking at the only waterbender in the whole South Pole.
Maybe, but we haven't had contact with our sister tribe in a long time. It's not exactly "turn right at the second glacier". It's on the other side of the world.
Unsure. That's ... I mean, I don't know. I've never left home before.
Mockingly imitating a teacher. Okay, listen closely my young pupil. Inclines her head toward Aang. Catching penguins is an ancient and sacred art. She conjures a fish out of her sleeve. Observe!
Happily. I haven't done this since I was a kid!
On a slightly dark tone. A Fire Navy ship. And a very bad memory for my people. Aang begins to approach the wreckage. Aang, stop! We're not allowed to go near it! The ship could be booby-trapped!
Her voice echoes through the room. This ship has haunted my tribe since Gran-Gran was a little girl. The camera shifts through the room, revealing all the weapons more closely. It was part of the Fire Nation's first attacks.
Aang, how long were you in that iceberg?
I think it was more like a hundred years!
Think about it. The War is a century old. You don't know about it because, somehow, you were in there the whole time! Aang's expression changes to one of comprehension. It's the only explanation.
Squats beside him. I'm sorry, Aang. Maybe somehow there's a bright side to all this ...
Smiling warmly at him while offering her hand. Come on, let's get out of here.
Aang, let's head back, this place is creepy.
Aaah!
Rises from her hunched-over position; turns to face Sokka smugly. What? Like you're ready to go right now, naked guy? Smiles at him smugly.
Turns her attention back to Aang. Right, let me see your stance.
Walks under his right arm. Your arms are too far apart. Positions his arms closer together. See, if you move them closer together, you protect your center. You got it?
Walks away and assumes a fighting stance. Okay, let's see what you got.
Proudly. You make a fine octopus, Pupil Aang.
We're not river people.
Sokka's right. We need to find King Bumi, so Aang can learn earthbending somewhere safe.
Is this real or a legend?
In a serious tone. That's no campfire, Moku.
It's okay, Appa. We'll be fine. I hope.
Sokka, this is the tenth dead end you've led us to.
Hold up a hand in warning. Everyone be quiet. Listen.
Cheerfully. Aang, look!
This isn't the exit.
These pictures tell their story.
Voice-over. They met on top of the mountain that divided their two villages ...
Voice-over. The villages were enemies, so they could not be together ... Character flashes red as the background turns grim and dark. but their love was strong and they found a way.
Voice-over. The two lovers learned earthbending from the badgermoles; they became the first earthbenders.
Voice-over. They built elaborate tunnels, so they could meet secretly. The pattern of a labyrinth appears. Anyone who tried to follow them would be forever in the labyrinth. The couple kisses. But, one day, the man didn't come Cuts to a shot of the woman alone, looking startled. - he'd died in the war between the two villages. Arrows fly by the screen. The woman is seen weeping by a grave. Devastated, the woman unleashed a terrible display of her earthbending power - she could have destroyed them all ... The woman is seen displaying her immense earthbending power. but, instead, she declared the war over. Cuts to shot of the woman standing on a hill surrounded by the two villages. Both villages helped her build a new city where they would live together in peace. Shows picture of the current-day Omashu. The woman's name was Oma and the man's name was Shu. The characters for "Oma" appear followed by the character for "Shu". Flashback ends. The great city was named Omashu as a monument to their love.
Reading the inscription on the relief in the wall. Love is brightest Cuts to shot of a carving of the couple kissing. in the dark.
I have a crazy idea.
Hesitant. Walks away, slightly embarrassed. Never mind. It's too crazy.
I was thinking ... the curse says we'll be trapped in here forever unless we trust in love ...
Turns to face him and gestures to the portrait. And here, it says, "Love is brightest in the dark," and has a picture of them kissing.
Shyly, blushing. Well, what if we ... kissed?
See? It was a crazy idea.
Fake-jokingly. Us kissing. What was I thinking? Can you imagine that‌?
Insulted. Oh, well! I didn't realize it was such a horrible option. Angrily. Sorry I suggested it!
Disgusted. Ugh!
Enraged. Well, I'm not sure which I'd rather do! Slams the torch into his hand and storms away.
I think so ...
What can we do?
That's how the two lovers found each other. Gestures with her hand along the ceiling. They just put out their lights and followed the crystals. Sees the exit. That must be the way out! The two hug.
Let's go!
Sokka!
Why is your forehead all red?
Displeased, raises foot warily. Oh, gross!
Sarcastically. Ah, the beauty of spring.
Waving arms about, now coated in fur. Stop! Appa, stop! Ugh! Coughs.
Wiping fur off her clothing with her eyes closed. I'm just glad we finally have another girl in the group, because you two are disgusting.
So Toph, usually when setting up camp, we try to divide up the work.
Well, actually what I'm trying to say is, Holds arms out in gesture. some of us might fetch water, while someone else might set up the fire pit, or put up the tent. Momo flies over to her, dropping several berries he had collected into her hands. Even Momo does his fair share.
Slightly irritated. Well, that's great for you, but we still need to finish -
Waves her hand dismissively and walks away. Never mind.
Rubs back of head sheepishly. Hey Toph, I wanted to apologize for earlier. I think we're all just a little tired and getting on each other's nerves.
Growing disgusted. I meant all of us.
Slightly irked. Good night.
Should we leave?
What is that thing?
Actually, can you help us unload?
Curtly. Well, yeah. That and everything else. You're a part of our team now, and -
Angrily. That's not the point. Approaches Toph. Ever since you joined us, you've been nothing but selfish and unhelpful!
Furiously. "Sugar queen"?! Toph uses earthbending to close the door of the tent. D-did you just slam the door in my face?! How can you be so infuriating?!
"Both"?! Rapidly turns to face Aang, her expression crazed and her eyes bloodshot. I'm completely calm!!
Mockingly. The stars sure are beautiful tonight. Too bad you can't see them, Toph!
Seriously, what is that thing?
Angrily; pulling her sleeping bag under her head as a pillow. That's good because Toph wasn't going to help anyway!
It could be Zuko. Rolls over on her side. We haven't seem him since the North Pole.
Mockingly. What's wrong with ponytails, Ponytail?
Jokingly. Well, it certainly tells the other warriors that you're fun and perky.
Nervously. Let's get out of here.
Alarmed. It's those three girls from Omashu!
Shocked. I can't believe those girls followed us all the way from Omashu.
Are you kidding me? Points fingers upward repeatedly in gesture. The crazy blue firebending and the flying daggers are bad enough, but last time we saw them, one of those girls did something that took my bending away. That's scary.
Every time we land, those girls are there. So we'll just have to keep flying.
I'm sure we'll come up with something after a short nap. Smiles.
Irritated. Of course, we could've gotten some sleep earlier, Depicts shot of Toph lying on the ground sleepily. if Toph didn't have such issues.
Irritated. I'm just saying. Maybe if you helped out earlier, we could have set up our camp faster and gotten some sleep Shouting. and then maybe we wouldn't be in this situation!
Angrily. No, I'm blaming her!
Regretfully. I know. We're all just trying to get used to each other. And I was so mean to her.
Sarcastically. Thanks, Sokka.
We need to find Toph and apologize.
Are you sure he's okay to fly?
Shocked; urges Appa forward. How did they find us?
He's too tired!
Pleading. Come on Appa, just a little further ...
Voice-over. You did it Appa!
Frantically. Well, you know ...
Happily. Thanks.
Zuko, I can help.
Excitedly. Look, the Inner Wall! Cut to a shot of the monorail approaching the wall. Cut back inside monorail. I can't believe we finally made it to Ba Sing Se in one piece.
Sympathetically. Don't worry Aang, we'll find Appa.
What's that wall for?
Nervous look on her face. Why do they have all these poor people blocked off in one part of the city?
Close-up. What's inside that wall?
Tight side-view of the gang and Pong. Get in trouble with who?!
I got it! I know how we're going to see the Earth King!
Side-view of her and Aang. Reading from the papers. The king is having a party at the palace tonight for his pet bear.
No, it just says 'bear'.
Side-view of room. Just ... bear.
Growing excited again. The palace will be packed. We can sneak in with the crowd!
Frontal view. Slightly confused. Why not?
Frontal view. Excuse me? I've got no manners?! You're not exactly "lady fancy fingers!"
To Sokka and Aang. We'll get in the party, and then find a way to let you in through the side gate.
Side-view. Sir, I'm sorry to bother you, but my cousin lost our invitations. Whispering. She's blind. Again, normally. Do you think you could help us? Our family's inside and I'm sure they're very worried.
View of her and Toph. I'm Kwa Mai, and this is ... Dum. Toph frowns and pulls a string hanging from Katara's headdress, causing her pain. Ow!
Side-view. Feigning looking around. Uh ... I don't see them right now, but I'm sure we'll find them soon. Smiles. Thanks for all your help.
Close-up of her face. Sorry, but the guy who escorted us in won't let us out of his sight!
Frontal view. So the king is just a figurehead.
You can't keep the truth from all these people. They have to know.
Surprised. What happened to Joo Dee?
Zuko!
Why did they throw you in here? Zuko says nothing. Oh, wait, let me guess. It's a trap. So that when Aang shows up to help me, you can finally have him in your little Fire Nation clutches!
Continuing to lament. You're a terrible person! You know that? Always following us! Hunting the Avatar! Trying to capture the world's last hope for peace! But what do you care? You're the Fire Lord's son. Spreading war and violence and hatred is in your blood!
Angrily. I don't? How dare you! You have no idea what this war has put me through! Sits down. Me personally! She sits down and touches her necklace, begins to cry. The Fire Nation took my mother away from me.
Apologetic. I'm sorry I yelled at you before.
It's just that for so long now, whenever I would imagine the face of the enemy, it was your face.
No, no, that's-that's not what I mean. Approaches Zuko.
Maybe you could be free of it.
I have healing abilities.
Holds up a vial. This is water from the Spirit Oasis at the North Pole. It has special properties, so I've been saving it for something important. Moves in front of Zuko. I don't know if it would work, but ...
Aang!
Aang, I knew you would come. She hugs Aang again.
We've got to find Sokka and Toph.
I thought you had changed! She grunts.
Rises and places hands on hips. Sounds like you slept well.
Cut to a wide shot of the ocean; thick fog is visible on the horizon. Oh, no. Cut to a shot of Katara, appearing concerned. Sokka, do you think the fog will delay the invasion?
You made it, Dad! Cut to shot of Katara embracing her father happily.
Cut to zoomed out shot of Haru. Haru! Runs over and embraces him. It's so good to see you!
Cut to Katara speaking over Sokka as he continues talking. Wow, when he says the beginning he means the beginning beginning. Hakoda gets up and approaches Sokka.
I don't see any gates.
Speaking at the same time. Aang, I ...
We've been through so many things together, and I've seen you grow up so much. You're not that little goofy kid I found in the iceberg anymore. Aang blushes. I guess what I'm trying to say is, I'm really proud of you.
Yes, it is.
Aang, don't say that, of course you'll- Katara is cut off as Aang kisses her. After the kiss, Katara blushes and stares sadly after Aang as he confidently snaps his glider and flies away.
What? Right, I'm on it. Jumps onto Appa and waterbends a sphere of water around his head before submerging.
Dad?
How does that feel, dad?
You're hurt, badly. You can't fight anymore.
I'm doing everything I can.
No offense Sokka, but you're not exactly Mr. Healing Hands.
Don't be crazy Sokka.
I still think you're crazy, but I'm proud of you too.
Quizzically. Yeah. Is that ... is that Aang?
Worried. Wait! If they knew we were coming it could all be a trap. Looks at the others; the camera pans to the right. Maybe we should use the time we have left to make sure we all get out of here safely.
Stopping with her father. We can wait here if you want.
Doubtful. It's not over yet.
They're back!
Appa, you and I can help too. Mounts Appa and follows Aang.
We can't keep them all back! There's too many of them!
Why aren't they turning around to attack us again?
Surprised. What? Grabs Hakoda. We can't leave you behind! Looks at the rest of the invasion force. We won't leave anyone behind!
We'll miss you, Dad. The two hug him.
Aang, stop it. You know Toph did all she could. She saved our lives.
We're all concerned, but we can't afford to be fighting now.
Aang, wait!
We'd better start walking. We're the only people who know about the solar eclipse. We have to get that information to Ba Sing Se.
Come on guys, we've got to stick together.
Okay, but we've got to try to conserve it.
Sad tone. I'm sorry, it's all we have.
Worried. Sokka, wait! You shouldn't be eating strange plants!
Backing away from Sokka and the cactus. I don't know ...
Okay, I think you've had enough.
Wrapping her arm around Toph's shoulders. I don't think that's a good idea. Come on, we need to find Aang.
What is that?
Let's just keep moving. I hope Aang's okay ...
I'm sorry, Aang. I know it's hard for you right now but ... we need to focus on getting out of here.
Encouraging. Come on, Aang. We can do this if we work together. Right Toph?
Hopeful. Sokka? Any ideas how to find Ba Sing Se?
Grabs her head in annoyance. Ugh ... We're getting out of this desert, and we're going to do it together! Aang, get up. Everybody, hold hands. We can do this. We have to.
I think we should stop for the night.
This is the last of it. Everyone can have a little drink.
No, he hasn't.
Sokka, let me see the things you got from the library.
Sokka, I was there.
No, but we can find out which way Ba Sing Se is. We can use the stars to guide us. She pulls out a map of the stars. That way we can travel at night when it's cool and rest during the day.
Just try to get some sleep. We'll start again in a few hours.
Come on, get up. We need to go.
Well, we need to get moving if we want to get out of this sand pit.
Sadly. It's just a cloud. Wait! A cloud! Offers he pouch to Aang. Here, fly up and bend the water from that cloud into my pouch.
Disappointed. Wow ... there's hardly any in here.
Trying to keep everyone together. Let's just get moving. We need to head this direction.
A boat‌?
It's one of the gliders the sandbenders use! And look! It's got some kind of compass on it! Tapping the compass. I bet it can point us out of here! Aang, you can bend a breeze so we can sail it. We're going to make it!
The needle on this compass doesn't seem to be pointing north according to my charts.
That's what the compass is pointing to! That giant rock! It must be the magnetic center of the desert.
Hopeful. Maybe we can find some water there!
Irritated. You've been hallucinating on cactus juice all day and then you just lick something you find stuck to the wall of a cave‌?!
Sokka, there's nothing there!
We have to get out of here! I'm completely out of water to bend!
Come on, we're going down.
Toph, shoot a rock right there. Fire!
Yes. Now let's move.
On your left!
We found the sailer abandoned in the desert. We're traveling with the Avatar. She gestures at Aang. The leader's eyes widen a bit at this information. Our bison was stolen and we have to get to Ba Sing Se.
Are you sure?‌
Walking toward a poster on the kiosk, present in the middle of a crossroad. This should give us a good idea of what's around here.
Stares at the wanted poster. I think we better keep moving.
Swayed by Aang; while her head is bowed. I guess we could go check it out. Aang begins rejoicing.
Starts walking toward Appa and is followed by Aang. We'll wear disguises and if it looks like trouble, we'll leave.
I think we need some new disguises.
Sarcastically. "Flaming fire flakes", hot? What do you know?
Aang, hold on! Where are we going?
It's better that we don't attract any attention to ourselves.
While backing away. Uh.
It can't hurt just to talk to him.
I'm sure there's a good reason.
Aang, that's great, but you should take it slow.
Aang, you'll hurt yourself!
But you're a great master. You have powers that I will never know.
I'm fine, we've got to get out of here. Where's Aang? Sokka gestures to the cottage.
You'll have to eventually.
It's okay, Aang. I'm healed.
I'll explain later. But right now, we have to get out here. Zhao and his soldiers are attacking!
By the river. They captured Jeong Jeong.
Aang, you're burned! Let me help you. Katara heals the burn on Aang's arm.
I guess I always knew.
Amused. He tried to get the first fishhook out with another fishhook.
Surprised. Aang, what are you doing here? I thought you were looking for Appa.
And also the complaining guy.
His chi is blocked. Stops healing. Who did this to you?
Eyes widen in realization. Ty Lee. She doesn't look dangerous, but she knows the human body and its weak points. It's like she takes you down from the inside.
Yes?
They come to fix it!
Appears behind him. Hi.
Crosses her arms. What's this "we" stuff? Aang and I are going to have to do all the work.
Explodes with frustration. Grrr!
Panting in exhaustion. At this rate, we won't do enough damage before the drill reaches the wall.
This is bad, really bad.
So we just need to weaken the braces, instead of cutting all the way through.
Wait. Throws him her water skin. You need this water more than I do!
Reads a sign nearby, while Sokka struggles to open the hatch. Slurry pipeline? What does that mean?
Hatefully and tauntingly. Why don't you try blocking my chi now, circus freak?
Irritated. You know, I'm just about sick and tired of you telling me what to do all day! You're like a chattering hog-monkey!
Toph, help me plug up this drain.
Unamused. Enough with the Team Avatar stuff. No matter how many times you say it, it's not going to catch on.
Begins walking away. Let's talk about this on our way into the city.
Sokka ...
One good hour after weeks of trouble isn't much of a roll.
Sokka, Long Feng is in control of the city. His conspiracy with the Dai Li is too powerful. I think we should just keep flying and leave this horrible place behind us.
Thinks for a moment. Well, I guess if the Earth King knew the truth, things could change. Sokka and Aang smile.
Determined. Let's fly!
We have to be careful. Long Feng's probably warned the king that we're coming.
Water whips two guards. Sorry!
Sorry! We just need to get through to see the Earth King!
You have to trust us.
So you've never been outside the Upper Ring before?
The Dai Li must've known we were coming and destroyed the evidence!
Smiles with realization. The wall. They'll never be able to cover that up in time.
Sarcastically. Really? Then perhaps you could explain why there's a Points to the drill as Kuei follows to where she is pointing. Cut to the Fire Nation insignia clearly shown on the drill. Fire Nation insignia on your "construction project".
Opens the scroll and reads it. It's a letter from your mom. Your mom's here in the city. And she wants to see you. Toph's eyes widen with shock.
Is there a letter for me and Sokka by any chance?
Opens the scroll and reads it. "A small fleet of Water Tribe ships."
Reads the report with excitement. "Protecting the mouth of Chameleon Bay. Her and Sokka's eyes widen. Led by Hakoda." Katara and Sokka turn to each other in excitement. It is Dad!
And I can't believe we know where our dad is now.
I hate to say it, but we have to split up.
You have to meet this guru, Aang. If we're going to invade the Fire Nation, you need to be ready.
No, Sokka. I know how badly you wanna help Dad. You go to Chameleon Bay. I'll stay here with the king.
Easy there, big brother ... Gives a slight chuckle. Though you're right. I am.
What is it, Aang?
Aang turns to Appa. Wait. Aang. She hugs him, which startles him, then kisses him on the cheek, causing him to blush.
Hugs Toph with Aang. Sokka looks away, crossing his arms. Me too.
Doesn't it seem kind of weird that we're hiding from the Fire Lord in his own house?
What? How is that possible?
Sokka, do you really think it's a good idea for us to attend a play about ourselves?
Don't worry, I'll tell your feet what's happening.
With crossed arms, displeased. Well, that's just silly. I don't sound like that.
Complacently amused. Actually, I think that actor's pretty spot on.
Relax, Aang. They're not accurate portrayals. It's not like I'm a preachy crybaby who can't resist giving overemotional speeches about hope all the time. Everyone looks at her. What?
Well Toph, what you hear up there is the truth. It hurts, doesn't it?
To Zuko. You didn't really say that, did you?
Does anyone know where Aang is?
I'm gonna check outside.
Are you all right?
I know it's upsetting, but it sounds like you're overreacting.
In where? What are you talking about?
I didn't say that. An actor said that.
Aang, I don't know.
Because, we're in the middle of a war, and, we have other things to worry about. This isn't the right time.
Aang, I'm sorry, but right now I'm just a little confused.
I just said I was confused! I'm going inside. Exits the balcony.
No kidding.
I'm sorry. I'm just laughing at the irony. You know, how it would've been nice for us if you lost your firebending a long time ago.
Holding up her bowl and glaring at Zuko. Maybe you're not as good as you think you are.
Still holding her bowl. That's ridiculous. She drinks from the bowl.
Oh, yeah‌? What's your little form called‌?
Excitedly. Look!
Smiling and approaching him. Thanks, Aang. Takes the necklace. I love it.
Off-camera. So, how do I look?
Annoyed. Stop teasing him, Sokka. Aang's just a good friend. Pats the side of his head. A sweet, little guy! Just like Momo. Pets Momo, who lands on Aang's shoulder.
Cups a hand to her mouth and makes gestures with her other hand. Run downhill, then climb a tree!
Looks off to the side as she ponders this. Wow, it must be. Faces the man with a bright expression on her face. That explains why you were so calm!
Excitedly. Maybe we should go see Aunt Wu and learn our fortunes. It could be fun.
That proves it! She ducks under the umbrella.
Smugly. I guess you're not really getting wet then.
Just admit you might be wrong, and you can come under the umbrella.
Excitedly. Really?
Try to keep an open mind, Sokka. There are things in this world that just can't be explained. Wouldn't it be nice to have some insight into your future?
Rising in anticipation. I guess that's me.
Actually, I have this special seaweed lotion. I can get you some if you want. Aang sticks out his tongue; slight pause. So, do you see anything interesting in my love line? Aang immediately perks up upon hearing this.
Excitedly. Tell me more!
You're just saying that because you're going to make yourself unhappy your whole life.
Satisfied. Well, I liked my predictions. Clasps her hands together anxiously. Certain things are going to turn out very well.
Why? What did she tell you?
Looking at the sky. What's with the sky?
Laying a hand on Sokka's shoulder. Shhh! She's coming!
Annoyed. Shhh!
Hi, Aunt Wu! Sorry to bother you.
About this man I'm supposed to marry ... Looks down awkwardly and blushes. Is he going to be handsome? Clasps her hands together hopefully. Oh, I hope he's tall!
Yes, please!
Lifts her palm in wonder. Wow, thanks, Aunt Wu. She rises and prepares to leave, but suddenly turns back. Oh wait, one more thing. How warmly should I dress tomorrow?
Okay, okay, but one more thing.
Puts a hand to her chin thoughtfully. Should I eat a mango or a papaya for breakfast tomorrow?
Kicks the ground, sending up a small cloud of dust. Aww, I hate papaya.
Half-heartedly. Hey, Aang. Walks away.
Less than pleased. Ugh, papaya please.
Uh huh. Would you like some?
Begins walking away. Okay then. See you later.
Annoyed. Can you believe she won't let me in? And after all the business I've given her?
I know, but still ...
Slightly irked, raises finger accusingly. Sokka, you tried to convince me she was wrong before. It's going to take an awful lot to change my mind -
Worriedly. Oh no.
Stepping forward. If you won't listen to him, maybe you'll listen to me. I want to believe Aunt Wu and her predictions as much as you do, but my brother and Aang saw the lava with their own eyes.
Dismayed. They just won't listen to reason. Aang leaps down from the awning.
Reading Aunt Wu's book. I found it. The symbol for volcanic doom.
It's too much! It's gonna overflow!
Wait, what did you just say?
Slowly widens her eyes in realization; as if having an epiphany. I suppose he is.
Holding Sokka by the shoulders and leading him away. It's okay, Sokka. Everything's going to be all right.
Brightly. Goodbye everyone! It was so nice to meet you! To Meng. Take care, Meng.
Um, aren't you forgetting the tarp?
Sokka, you're supposed to put the tarp on top of the tent. You know, so we don't get rained on? Cut to an overhead shot of the two, Sokka gesturing widely as he replies to his sister.
But what if it does rain?
You're infuriating!
Angrily. Well, if you don't like my firewood- Throws the sticks at Sokka who shields himself from the wood. He stands in anger after the hail of sticks subsides.
Oh yeah? Well, you're Mister Lazy Bum, King of the Picks up and throws a twig at Sokka's head. Tents! Sokka turns around, looking angrily at her.
Sounds good.
In awe. Wow, I could just stare at it forever. Zoom backward to show Sokka in the foreground.
How can you not be fascinated Sokka? This is the largest canyon in the entire world.
Ooh, canyon guide? Sounds informative.
You're a refugee!
Is that your tribe?
Uh, one of them, I think. Camera pans left to reveal the Zhang and the scout.
Over the two arguing tribes. Well Aang, ready to put your peace-making skills to the test?
Stepping forward. Everybody listen up! This is the Avatar, and if you give him a chance, I'm sure he can come up with a compromise that will make everyone happy.
He's the Avatar, Sokka, making peace between people is his job.
Your arms, they're broken!
You really think it'll rain?
So it was you guys who had food!
Hesitates. Well, I guess it's okay if everyone's doing it. Takes the bread and eats it. So, why does your tribe hate the Zhangs so much?
I don't think so, Aang, the Zhangs really wronged the Gan Jins. They ambushed Jin Wei and stole the sacred orb.
Not punished enough if you ask me.
Oh no, that's a lot of canyon crawlers.
Sokka, wait. Stops him as he runs forward. I don't care about this stupid feud, I just want us to get out of here alive.
Shocked. You did not! In devilish admiration. That is so wrong.
Or we could send in Momo to do some damage! Chuckles. The Council of Five are unamused. 'Cause, the ... sorry.
I'll get these scrolls to him right away. Thank you, General How.
What do you say, Momo? A cup of tea before we get back to the king? Arrives at the shop. Table for two, please.
Thank goodness you're here, Suki. Something terrible is going on. The Fire Nation has infiltrated the city, I just saw Prince Zuko and his uncle! Azula widens her eyes in surprise and smiles slyly. We have to tell the Earth King right away!
Cut to Katara, standing near Aang, from behind Sokka. Sokka, we don't need to become cave people. What we need is some new clothes.
I call the silk robe! Jumps out from behind the rock wall and grabs two outfits.
Walks partially on camera. How do I look? The camera pans from Katara's dress to her whole outfit.
Oh, Touches necklace. oh, yeah. I guess it's pretty obviously Water Tribe, isn't it? Takes off the necklace and holds it in her hand.
Concernedly. Where have you been? We've been worried sick.
Sapphire Fire. Nice to meet you.
My goodness! That doesn't sound like our Kuzon.
Barely hiding her envy as she looks away. Eh, if that's what you like ... She looks back surreptitiously.
Looks away nervously. I don't know, Aang. Starts nervously pulling her hair. These shoes aren't really right for dancing, and I-I'm not sure that I know how to-
Smiles back. Okay.
Looking around. Aang, everyone's watching.
We're safe Sokka, you can take off the mustache now.
Well, that was some dance party Aang. She kisses him on the cheek, and Aang blushes.
Seriously ... what else you got?
An earthbender!
Suddenly Katara is a few feet in front of them, excitedly addressing the earthbender. Hello there! I'm Katara! What's your name?
Shrugging. I just wanted to say hi.
Excitedly. Which means no nuts for dinner!
Notices the boy enter a shop. Speaks to herself in surprise. Hey ...
Enters the shop's front door, startling Haru. Hey. You're that kid. Why did you run away before?
Curiously. But, Haru's an earthbender? He can help!
How can you say that? Haru has a gift! Asking him not to earthbend is like asking me not to waterbend. It's a part of who we are.
I understand that Haru can help you fight back. What can the Fire Nation do to you that they haven't done already?
I'm sorry about what I said earlier. I didn't know about your father.
Flattered. Thanks.
He sounds like a great man.
So that's why you hide your earthbending.
Sits beside Haru, sets her fingertips on her necklace. See this necklace? My mother gave it to me.
I lost my mother in a Fire Nation raid. Hangs her head, turning away. This necklace is all I have left of her.
No. Hangs her head and turns away.
Haru braces his back against the mine entrance. Katara pulls the old man. Ugh! It's not working! We have to get help!
Getting an idea. Haru. There's a way you can help him.
Please, there's no one around to see you. It's the only way!
Excitedly. Haru! You did it! The two take place beside the old man and aid him walking away from the mine.
It was so brave of Haru to use his earthbending to help that old man.
I guess so.
Unhappily. Dawn?! Can't we sleep in for once?
Slyly, with a wry smirk. I'd rather eat fireballs than nuts.
Enters barn to see Aang and Sokka folding blankets; emotionally. They took him! They took Haru away!
Hurriedly. The old man turned him in to the Fire Nation - it's all my fault - I forced him into earthbending!
Haru's mother said they came for him at midnight.
Turns defiantly to the open door, clenches fists. We don't need to track him. The Fire Nation is going to take me right to Haru.
Determined. Because they're going to arrest me for earthbending. Aang and Sokka share a horrified look.
Props hands off hips, turns to Aang. Aang? Did you get all that?
Angrily hunched over. How dare you call me pipsqueak, you giant-eared cretin!
Far too dramatically as her hair loopies move with her motion. A giant-eared cretin! Look at those things! Do herds of animals use them for shade?! Imitates an elephant's ears.
More determined, heightens above her now-cowering brother. I will not back off! I bet elephants get together and make fun of how large your ears are!
I'll show you who's boss! Angrily points at Sokka. Earthbending style! Over-dramatically leaps toward the boulder, clenching her fist upward to which there is no reaction. Angrily. I said, earthbending style!
Excitedly. Runs and hugs Haru. Haru!
Somewhat apologetically. It's my fault you were captured. I came to rescue you.
It was the only way to find you.
Slightly bows. It's an honor to meet you.
If you don't mind me asking, what's your escape plan?
You know, the plan to get everyone off the rig? What is it? Mutiny, sabotage?
Shocked. How can you say that? You sound like you've already given up!
Obstinately. We'll see about that.
Earthbenders! You don't know me, but I know of you. Every child in my Water Tribe village was rocked to sleep with stories of the brave Earth Kingdom, and the courageous earthbenders who guard its borders. The watchman walks up to talk the warden, but the warden stops him and listens. Some of you may think that the Fire Nation has made you powerless. Yes, they have taken away your ability to bend. But they can't take away your courage. And it is your courage they should truly fear! Because it runs deeper than any mine you've been forced to dig, any ocean that keeps you far from home! It is the strength of your hearts that make you who you are. Hearts that will remain unbroken when all rock and stone has eroded away. The time to fight back is now! I can tell you the Avatar has returned! So remember your courage earthbenders, Shouts clearly. let us fight for our freedom!
I can't.
I'm not leaving. Aang and Sokka share a questionable look. I'm not giving up on these people.
We can't abandon these people! There has to be a way to help them.
Sternly. No!
I tried talking the earthbenders into fighting back but, it didn't work! If there was just a way to help them help themselves.
Lays her palm to the surface. But this entire place is made of metal!
It's almost dawn. We're running out of time! You sure this is gonna work?
Lifting up a piece of coal. Here's your chance, earthbenders! Take it! Your fate is in your own hands!
Turning to face Haru. Denying. All it took was a little coal.
So, I guess you're going home now.
I can't. Your mission is to take back your home. Ours is to get Aang to the North Pole. Gazes over the rail to see Momo join Aang atop Appa's head, floating in the ocean.
I know. Reaches for her necklace wistfully, but realizes it is not around her neck and panics. My mother's necklace! It's gone!
What? Appa's not too noticeable!
Leans forward at her brother and smiles. Who made you the boss?
Amused. You're the leader? But your voice still cracks!
Close-up shot of Katara's face. If anyone's the leader, it's Aang. I mean he is the Avatar. Pan back to Sokka.
Why do boys always think someone has to be the leader? I bet you wouldn't be so bossy if you kissed a girl.
Back to Sokka. Who? Gran-Gran? I've met Gran-Gran.
Sarcastically. Okay, we'll try it your way, oh wise leader.
Sarcastically. Well I don't know, Aang. Why don't you ask Sokka's instincts? They seem to know everything.
You know who you should ask to carry it for a while? Sokka's instincts. Sokka's eyes turn to her in irritation.
Whispers. What are you doing?
Points up a tree. Look!
Hi.
Approaching Jet. Umm, thanks for saving us Jet. We're lucky you were there.
Eyeing Sokka. We were relying on instincts.
Very excitedly. Yes, we wanna see it!
It's beautiful up here!
As Aang zips by again. Why does the Fire Nation want to find you?
That's so brave. Sokka manages to get by Pipsqueak.
Don't pay any attention to my brother.
So, you all live here? Sokka who is being ignored comically sinks back behind them.
What about you?
Sokka and I lost our mother to the Fire Nation.
Hey Jet, nice speech.
Well, he's great. He's the Avatar. Blushes. I could use some more training.
Hey, Sokka. Is Jet back?
But I made him this hat. She shows a cap made out of stitched leaves with a flower on top.
What? No, he's not.
I wanna hear Jet's side of the story. The scene changes to Jet in a room.
No, he conveniently left that part out.
I knew there was an explanation.
See, Sokka? I'm sure you just didn't notice the knife.
We can't leave now with the Fire Nation about to burn down a forest!
You know what I think? You're jealous that he's a better warrior and a better leader!
Well my instincts tell me we need to stay here a little longer and help Jet. Come on Aang.
Jet, I'm sorry about how Sokka's been acting.
Yeah, I did.
I'm glad he cooled off. He's so stubborn sometimes.
I've never used bending on water I can't see. I don't know ... Jet stands behind her and places his hands on her shoulders.
When we're done we'll meet you over there.
Let's catch up with Jet at the reservoir.
Well, we finished early. I'm sure he'll be happy to see us.
What are they doing?
Why would they need blasting jelly? Zooms on Aang, who is horrified.
What? No, that would destroy the town. Jet wouldn't do that. Aang opens his glider.
Less convinced. Jet wouldn't do that.
Jet, why?
This isn't the answer!
Where's Sokka? Tears fall from her eyes. Jet reaches out and touches her face.
Why, Jet? I can't believe I trusted you. You lied to me, you're sick and I trusted you! A birdcall is heard. Katara and Aang are startled, and look to the valley beyond where it's coming from. Jet gives an answering birdcall. What are you doing?
Horrified. No!
Come on, Sokka. I'm sorry I ever doubted you, please.
Whispers. No ...
All those people ... She turns in rage back to Jet. Jet, you monster!
Sokka!
Goodbye Jet. Sokka gives Appa's reigns a flick.
Let me guess, your instincts told you.
Close-up; impressed. Wow. We don't have buildings like this in the South Pole!
Stretching her arm out to him, halting Aang with her cry. Wait, Aang! It could be dangerous if people find out you're the Avatar.
Glancing at Sokka. Technically, Aang is 112 years old.
Waving. Hi. June Pippinpaddleopsicopolis. Nice to meet you.
Lightheartedly. We will!
Uneasy. It sounded like fun at first, Shot switches to a bird's eye view, fully revealing the steepness of the chute. but now that I'm here, I'm starting to have second Aang leans forward, tipping the balance of the box, sending it down the slope at a tremendous speed, making Katara scream out her last word. th-o-o-oughts!
Scared. Aang, do something! Use your airbending!
Quietly to Aang. Is it just me, or Turns circles with her index finger beside her temple, implying the king is crazy. is this guy's crown a little crooked?
Accusingly. You can't keep us here! Let us leave!
This is a prison cell? But it's so nice.
Determined. We're not sticking around to find out. There's got to be some way out of here.
Climbing into her bed. Well, no point arguing about it now. Get some rest, Aang. Aang walks toward his bed. Looks like you'll need it for tomorrow.
Other than the crystals slowly encasing my entire body, doing great!
Think about the challenges. Maybe it's some kind of riddle.
We're going to keep trying, but that is a good back-up.
And what did you learn?
The jennamite grows as she talks with anxiety. And?
Uh, over here!
So this crazy king is your old friend Bumi?
Cheerfully. We found a printer to make our posters! Reveals the poster and Aang smiles and points at it.
Takes the picture from Sokka, looks confused. Why are feet coming out of it?
Let's just stick with the professional version.
It's only been a day. Just be patient. Aang sits, unenthused. 
But then they replaced you with some other woman who also said her name was Joo Dee.
Bending up remaining water from the wave. Tell it to some other girl, Jet! Turns the water to ice, which sends Jet back to a wall.
Jet's back. Close-up of Jet's face. Cut to aerial view before switching to a closer view of the group. We can't trust anything Jet says.
I don't care why he's here, whatever the reason is, it can't be good!
You're lying!
All right. Points and looks angrily at Jet. But we're not letting you out of our sight.
Preparing to waterbend in defense. If this is a trap–
Aang, it will take us weeks just to get to the tip of the Earth Kingdom. And then we'll need to find a boat to get to the island.
Don't you have some more hair to clean up?
You're right Aang, right now our first concern has to be finding Appa. We can come back when we have him.
We don't need your help!
Gee, I wonder.
What ... no! She folds her arms and looks away defiantly.
Looks at Jet angrily. I thought you said you didn't have your "gang" anymore!
Shocked. The Dai Li?!
That's impossible.
The Dai Li must have sent Jet to mislead us, and that janitor was part of their plot, too!
Maybe you should kiss him, Sokka!
Close your eyes. Picture it.
Maybe this will help. Takes water and puts it around his ears, using healing to clear his mind.
This isn't good.
We're not going to leave you.
Walks next to Aang. Yeah, what's wrong with having a little fun in our down time?
All right, we'll finish our vacations and Mockingly. then we'll look for Sokka's intelligence. Aang laughs.
Pointing at the map. How about the Misty Palms Oasis? That sounds refreshing.
Examines the map while the camera pans across it. You've made a lot of trips into the desert.
Puts her hand on the side of Sokka's face to stop him from talking. I think he means they look like actual foxes, Sokka.
It shouldn't be this hard to spot a giant, ornate building from the air.
Holding the illustrations. Forget it. It's obviously not what we're looking for. Side shot. The building in this drawing is enormous.
You got something against libraries?
Sheepishly. Oh, right. Sorry.
Camera pans up to show her holding the waterbending scroll. I have an authentic waterbending scroll.
Walks up to Aang, carrying a book. Aang, did you know in a past life, you were left-handed?
They destroyed everything having to do with the Fire Nation.
Maybe these dials represent dates and times. Sokka, try entering that date from that parchment you took.
Hey, wait. What happened to the sun?
That makes sense. I mean, think what the lunar eclipse at the North Pole did to the waterbenders. This is huge.
Sand pours from the ceiling. He's sinking the building. We've gotta get out of here.
Sokka, let's go.
Don't be stupid! We'll find out later!
But ...!
Hurry, Sokka!
Cut to a shot of Sokka and Katara looking at the professor. Katara looks up at Sokka. Just go!
Nice choice, Sokka. And we're here four days ahead of schedule.
Sokka's got the right idea, Aang. We're here. We're ready. The best thing we can do now is get plenty of rest. Lies down.
Hey. How long have you been up?
Aang stops, panting. You know, there is such a thing as over-training.
Aang, it's the middle of the night. You need to go back to sleep.
Aang, sleep. Please. For me.
Putting a hand on the side of his face. Aang! I know you're just trying to help, but you really need to get a grip. You're unraveling.
Approaching Sokka, annoyed. Sokka! You're not helping!
You know what, I've got just the thing! Get ready to be de-stressified!
These yoga stretches can really work wonders if you do them in extreme heat. Reach up. Katara puts her hands above her head together, Aang follows along. Reach for the sun. They wave their hands and upper bodies side to side. Feel your chi paths clearing. Both bend over so their heads touch the ground, grabbing their legs. Now close your eyes. How are you feeling?
Good, good. Go on.
Maybe your stress is the kind you need to talk out.
So, do you feel less stressed? Ready for a good night's sleep?
What happened, Aang?
Approaching. You don't look so good. You sure you can't just lie down for a little nap?
Aang, staying up all night can't be good for you.
What big things?
Aang, what are you saying?
After kissing for a while she pulls back, whispering slightly. What are we doing?
Aang! Aang realizes he was just daydreaming, and realizes he is not holding Katara anymore. I was just saying you should take a nap.
What was your dream about?
Initially confused, she smiles back. Sounds neat!
Aang? We're all starting to get a little worried about you.
Concerned. Aang ...
I'm not going to hit you.
Approaching Aang, placing a hand on his shoulder. Listen to me. You've been training for this since the day we met. Moves behind him, talking over his shoulder. I've seen your progress. You're smart, brave, and strong enough.
Excitedly. Was it realistic? Is that how it was back then?
Moving to sit at the back of the saddle with her brother. Do you think we'll really find airbenders?
Crossing her arms, obviously angry with him. Are you saying I'm a liar?
Amazed. They really are airbenders!
I don't know, Aang.Katara points to the boy. That kid seemed pretty spirited. Katara indicates to the boy, who is flying dangerously close, but still laughing.
Katara approaches Teo, who seems disappointed at Aang's reaction. Aang used to come here a long time ago. I think he's a little shocked it's so ... different.
Walks up and puts her hand on his shoulder. I'm sure some parts of the temple are still the same.
Pokes hermit crab. You're right. They're kind of keepers of the temple's origins. Katara hands it to Aang. It moves around in his hand and he smiles.
Hey, it's just like the one in the other temple!
She looks at him, as though slightly scared of his reaction. Her tone is gentle and questioning. Aang?
Nervously. I've changed my mind. I think I was born without that something.
No! Jumps off anyway. Aaaaah! Starts to fall down wards, but eventually starts to fly straight. Her scream peters off as she begins laughing. I can't believe I'm flying!
Teo was right about the air. All I had to do was trust it, let it carry me.
Wait! Katara flies by. How do I land this thing? What if I land over a-ack-ack-bleck! Bug! Bug! Ack, that was a bug!
Aang, what are we going to do? How can we possibly keep them all away?
Ugh, if only we knew. Teo, Katara, and Aang laugh.
Huh, that's actually pretty smart.
Worriedly. Yes. But where's Sokka with the war balloon?
Those things are unstoppable!
Water? Can you get me close to one?
Come on Sokka. Side-view of Katara. Where's that war balloon?
Cut to Aang and Katara on balcony. No, Sokka! Hold on! Aang jumps on his glider and flies toward them.
It looks like we'll need to go somewhere else to get food, Unrolls a long scroll in front of her. assuming that'll fit into Sokka's master schedule.
We're um ... from the Earth Kingdom colonies.
Why do you guys live on the river? Looking at the village.
Cut to three villagers sitting on a porch. Look at this place. Cut to two other villagers, an old man and a young boy. It's so sad. Cut back to Katara looking down. We have to do something to help.
Chases Sokka and grabs his shoulder. These people are starving! But you'd turn your back on them? Puts her hands on her hips. How can you be so cold and heartless?
Reluctantly. I guess so. Looks annoyed.
Touched. I wish I could help more. Gives the boy a fish, and the boy bows to her and leaves to give the fish to his sick mother.
Forty-three minutes?
No way!
I think Appa's sick.
It looks like he needs some medicine. Maybe we can find the right herbs in town.
The Painted who now?
Looks like we need to stay another night so Appa can rest.
Can you believe how much an entire village can be affected by one lady I mean ... spirit?
Gets annoyed. Why would you say that? Look how much better off these people are.
Using a disguised voice. Well, hello Avatar. I wish I could talk, but I am very busy.
Giggles nervously. Thank you, but-
A lot of people say that.
Look, I really should get going. Covers her face and runs, but Aang uses his airbending and blasts her hat up into the air, exposing her.
Guiltily. Hi, Aang.
I wasn't her at first, I was just trying to help the village. Takes her hat off. But since everyone thought that's who I was anyway, I guess I just kinda became her. Drops her hat on the ground.
He might be sick of the purple berries I've been feeding him, but other than that he's fine!
I'm sorry, I know I shouldn't have ...
Well, if you wanna help, there's one more thing I have to do.
Yes. Sokka was just kidding, but he was right. Getting rid of this factory is the only way to help these people permanently.
Shhh! Quietly. We don't wanna wake Sokka. She turns and sees that Sokka and Toph are awake. Hi, Sokka, we were just out on a morning walk!
I kind of destroyed their factory.
Defensively. It was your idea!
Well, what was I supposed to do?
Angrily. No, I will never, ever turn my back on people who need me! Gets up. I'm going down to that village, and I am gonna do whatever I can.
I thought you didn't want to help.
Sokka, you really do have a heart. The two hug.
Leave this village and never come back.
Sokka, it's okay. She steps forward and moves Sokka back. To the villagers. I shouldn't have acted like someone I wasn't, and I shouldn't have tricked you. But I felt like I had to do something. It doesn't matter if the Painted Lady is real or not. Because your problems are real, and this river is real. You can't wait around for someone to help you. You have to help yourself.
So, Dock, are you gonna help us clean?
You're looking at the only waterbender in the whole South Pole. This ship has haunted my tribe when Gran-Gran was a little girl. It was part of the Fire Nation's first attacks.
I always noticed my waterbending is stronger at night.
I'm making my own water!
No, wait! I've got one! And this is a true Southern Water Tribe story.
No, it happened to Mom.
One winter when Mom was a girl, a snowstorm buried the whole village for weeks. A month later, Mom noticed she hadn't seen her friend Nini since the storm. So Mom and some others went to check on Nini's family. When they got there, no one was home. Cuts to ground-level shot of the group sitting around the fire, the camera panning slightly to the right. Just a fire flickering in the fireplace. While the men went out to search, Mom stayed in the house. When she was alone, she heard a voice. In a scary voice. "It's so cold and I can't get warm!" Sokka stiffens in fear. Mom turned and saw Nini standing by the fire. She was blue like she was frozen. Mom ran outside for help, but when everyone came back, Nini was gone.
No one knows. Nini's house stands empty to this day, but sometimes, people see smoke coming up from the chimney, like little Nini is still trying to get warm.
You're probably just jumpy from the ghost stories ...
Thanks for letting us stay here tonight. You have a lovely inn.
That Mr. Yao seems to have a thing for you. Maybe we should go back and see if he'll give us some free komodo sausages?
Unpacking items. That's ridiculous. She's a nice woman who took us in and gave us a place to stay. Picks up cabbage. She kinda reminds me of Gran-Gran.
Gee, I don't know. Maybe because she found four strange kids camping in the woods at night? Isn't that a little mysterious?
Appears along with the others at the bottom of the stairwell. Sokka! Sokka, what are you doing? Off-camera as Sokka peers around the inn. You can't just snoop around someone's house.
Walking down hallway with the rest of the team. Sokka, you're gonna get us all in trouble and this is just plain rude!
Walks over and closes the cupboard; a bit weirded out. So she's got a hobby. There's nothing weird about that. Angrily. Sokka, you've looked enough. Off-camera as Sokka ascends into the attic. Hama will be back soon.
Annoyed. Probably to keep people like you from snooping through her stuff!
Approaches him. Sokka, what are you doing? You're breaking into a private room!
This is crazy! I'm leaving!
Stunned. You're from the Southern Water Tribe?
How did you know?
I knew I felt a bond with you right away.
Delighted. You're a waterbender! Faces Hama in delight. I've never met another waterbender from our tribe!
We completely understand. We lost our mother in a raid.
I can't tell you what it means to meet you. It's an honor. You're a hero.
Yes! Yes, of course! To learn about my heritage, it would mean everything to me.
I know! When we were stranded in the desert, I felt like there was almost nothing I could do.
I've even used my own sweat for waterbending.
Wow, these flowers are beautiful.
I met a waterbender who lived in a swamp and could control the vines by bending the water inside.
That was incredible! Sees the wilted lilies. It's a shame about the lilies, though.
Cautiously. But isn't that dangerous? I thought people have been disappearing around here during the full moon.
Unsure. But ... to reach inside someone and control them? Casts unsure glance off to the side. I don't know if I want that kind of power.
Close-up of her face. I know.
Widens eyes in realization. It's you ... Angrily. You're the one who's been making people disappear during the full moons!
Points to Hama, stretching out her left hand. I won't! I won't use bloodbending and I won't allow you to keep terrorizing this town! Her hand suddenly twists to one side. She tries desperately to stop it, but fails to do so.
Tearfully. Stop! Please ...
Determined. You're not the only one who draws power from the moon! Assumes a fighting stance. My bending is more powerful than yours, Hama. Your technique is useless on me!
Using waterbending to freeze him to a nearby tree. I'm sorry, Aang!
Horrified. No!
Cuts to shot of entire group standing on the cliffside overlooking the city. This is horrible, Approaches Aang; cuts to side-view of the two standing next to each other. but we have to move on.
I know you had your heart set on Bumi, but there are other people who can teach you earthbending.
That wasn't as bad as I thought.
Sorry. We were just on our way home.
Uh, he has pentapox, sir. As he approaches. Umm, it's highly contagious.
And deadly.
Let's find Bumi and get out of here.
Aang, what are you doing? Aren't you coming with us?
Worried, turns back to Yung. Oh no. Did someone get left behind?
Baby voice. Oooh, you're so cute. She kisses him on the cheek, while an annoyed Sokka looks the other side, resting his head on his hand. Mmmmm ...
Does that look like the face of a killer to you?
We've got to get the baby out of here!
There's Aang!
Crosses her arms. You brought this on yourself. I had no choice. Turns away from Toph with her arms folded.
Maybe you should take your own advice, Toph!
Oh, sorry. Did I splash you, Mud-Slug?
Wiping mud off of her face. I'll give you a mud pie!
Takes a few steps forward, covered in mud; calmly. Very well, pupil. I believe we've had enough training for today. Turns and walks away.
Where did you guys get the money to buy all this stuff?
Ah, so she cheated.
I'm just saying this isn't something we should make a habit of doing.
I don't hate fun! Places Momo on her head like a hat while grinning unconvincingly. See? Fun! Momo slips off her head, screeches at her, and runs away.
Guys, I think these scams have gone far enough. If you keep doing them, something bad is gonna happen.
Angrily. Oh, I'm sorry! You think I should be more like you? Like some wild child? Tosses the money back at Toph.
Ah. I see. You're acting like this because of your parents.
They were controlling over you, so you ran away, and now you act like your parents don't exist. You act like you hate them, but you don't. You just feel guilty.
I don't think so. I think you miss them, but you just don't wanna deal with that, so instead you act like this crazy person.
You know what? It doesn't matter. These scams put us all at risk, and we don't need that. Points at her forehead. We've already got some third-eyed freak after us.
Angrily. We have enough money! You need to stop this!
Sokka, Places her hand on her face; annoyed. tell me you didn't buy a bird.
Sarcastically. Well. Look who decided to join us. Stands up. Where have you two been? Off scamming again?
Slides to the right to behind Toph. And I suppose you don't think what you're doing is dangerous at all?
Really?
Starts to pull something out. Well then. What's this? Shows Toph her wanted poster.
It's a wanted poster of you! "The Runaway!" Is that what you're called now? Are you proud of this?
It doesn't matter where I got it. The fact is-
Your stuff was messy and I was just straightening up, and I happened to stumble across it!
Cut to a surprised Katara who glares at Toph. Pushes Toph's pointing hand out of her face. Fine! It's a lie! But you've been so out of control lately, I knew something was up! I knew you were hiding something and you were! Shows her the poster again, but Toph grabs it, tosses it and starts to walk past Katara. Don't you walk away from me while I'm talking to you!
I wish I could!
I never said I was!
I don't act that way! Looks at Sokka, who jumps as she says his name. Sokka, do I act motherly?
Looks at Aang. What do you think, Aang? Do I act like a mom?
Slightly annoyed. Stop rubbing your eye and speak clearly when you talk!
Well, I can't be around you!
I know this is from you, Sokka! Toph can't write! Tears the note up into pieces. Ugh! You're all driving me crazy! Turns and walks away.
Hi, Toph. Um, I wanna-
Smiles. Actually I wasn't going to apologize. I was gonna say ... I wanna pull a scam with you. Aang and Sokka stare at her from behind, extremely shocked.
Not just any scam. The ultimate scam. Sokka and Aang, still staring at her with shock, look at each other and faint, foaming from the mouth slightly. Katara puts her arm around Toph's shoulder, who gives a sly smile. Whaddaya say, Toph? Just me and you. One last go. You in?
The plan is simple: This wanted poster says you're worth a lot of money; Ten times more than you've made in all of your scams. So I'm gonna turn you in and collect the reward. Then you metalbend yourself out of jail, and we're on our way. As she speaks, the screen fades to the beginning of the episode, where Toph is seen running from the authorities and is caught in a net.
Crosses her arms. You brought this on yourself. I had no choice. Turns away from Toph.
The right thing is its own reward.
Pauses for a moment. But, I still want the actual reward.
Sarcastically. Really? No kidding! Is that why we're sitting in a wooden cage right now? Gee, how'd you figure out it was a trap?
I can't believe I'm so stupid! See? This is exactly why I'm against these scams! I knew this would happen!
I know. I wanted to show that I'm not so motherly. I wanted to show you that I can have fun too.
I know your relationship with your parents is complicated. And I shouldn't have said what I said.
What are we gonna do?
What about your meteor bracelet? You can make a saw.
Just fine.
I'm making my own water.
Aang, get up! She helps him up and they run away.
Sits back down. What is it, Toph?
Smiling. I'll be happy to help.
Blushing, while Jet and Zuko fight behind her. Haru, it's beautiful ... but you're too sensitive for me. Cut to Haru as his expression changes to a disappointed one and he facepalms.
What is it, Momo?
Aang, that's so sweet. I'd love to go to the dance with you.
Yes, Blushing. but I already decided to go with someone else.
Blushing, she catches the Blue Spirit's hand and walks away with him. What can I say? I like the quiet, mysterious type.
Excitedly. Waterbending bomb! Yeah! Jumps into the water.
Sorry. Wrings her hair dry and bends the water off the map.
Quietly. Shush up about Appa. Can't you at least try to be sensitive?
Surprised. Oh ... well, okay. I'm glad you're doing better.
Great! We can travel through the Serpent's Pass together.
Hmm ... peaceful ferry ride or deadly pass?
I can't believe how many people's lives have been uprooted by the Fire Nation.
You look so different without your makeup! And the new outfit.
Appa is missing. We hope to find him in Ba Sing Se.
It says, "abandon hope".
What are you talking about?
Okay, if you say so.
You know, it's okay to miss Appa. Aang remains silent. What's going on with you? In the desert, all you cared about was finding Appa and now it's like you don't care about him at all.
But now you're not letting yourself feel anything. I know sometimes it hurts more to hope and it hurts more to care. But you have to promise me that you won't stop caring.  Holds out her arms. Come on, you need a hug.
Everyone single file! She divides the water, allowing everyone to walk through the drowned out path. Aang, I need help! Aang helps by creating an air bubble.
What is that thing?
Sokka!
Sokka, calm down. I helped Gran-Gran deliver lots of babies back home.
It's called a baby and I helped her deliver plenty of those, too. Aang, get some rags. Sokka, water. Toph, I need you to make an earth tent, a big one. Toph earthbends the rock to form a tent. Suki, come with me.
You're doing great, Ying. Sokka, where's that water? Now get ready to push. One ... two ... Sokka enters. ... three, push!
From inside the tent. It's a girl!
Aang, you have to come see this.
She's beautiful.
You'll find him, Aang.
Sokka ...
Aang!
What happened?
I've always noticed my waterbending is stronger at night.
Approaching her. The Avatar is the bridge between our world and the Spirit World! Aang can talk to them!
The only problem is, last time you got to the Spirit World by accident. How are you going to get there this time?
Approaching the oasis. It's so warm here! How is that possible?
He's meditating, trying to cross over into the Spirit World. Aang scrunches up his face in concentration. It takes all his concentration.
He's crossing into the Spirit World. He'll be fine as long as we don't move his body. Cuts to overhead shot of the pond. That's his way back to the physical world.
Smiling. No, he's my friend. I'm perfectly capable of protecting him.
Alarmed and dismayed. No ...
Aang!
Dismayed. He took Aang. He took him right out from under me.
Off-screen; sorrowfully. I can't believe I lost him.
Okay. Closes eyes and gets up. Camera pans over to where Momo remains motionless on the ground. Cuts to shot of Appa, Katara having mounted the bison. It's all right. You stay here, Momo, in case Aang comes back.
I'm not worried they'll get away in the blizzard. I'm worried that they won't.
Look, that's gotta be Aang! Yip-yip!
Confidently while countering his fire blasts. Trust me Zuko, it's not going to be much of a match.
It's too late, it's dead.
What about Aang? He still needs to learn waterbending.
You too, Momo.
Wow, this is amazing to watch.
The fire is gonna destroy that town!
Jumps onto Appa's head, taking the reins. There's a creek over here. I'll bend the water onto the fire. Signals Appa to take off.
What's your problem? You haven't even touched your smoked sea slug.
That's not true. No one can read a map like you.
What? What's wrong with my hair? Blushes.
Approaches and sits next to him. I'm sorry you're feeling so down, but I hope you know, none of us see you that way. Frontal view of the two. Looks down for a moment before putting her hand on his shoulder. I know something that's going to make you feel better.
What's a wind sword?
Unconvincingly. Yeah ... nice.
Frontal view of Sokka with Katara behind. That's a great idea. I could've never gotten to where I am without Master Pakku. Everyone needs a teacher.
Sokka's been in charge of the schedule. I'm not sure what we should be doing.
Camera pans across to show Katara. I-It's so hot, it's so hot ... Momo is shedding like Appa. Pets Momo and flicks tufts of fur from her fingers. Huh, huh‌?
Oh, everyone's a critic.
So where are we going next‌? Cut to a shot of Aang and Katara sitting around a map of the Fire Nation. Pointing to the map. We're starting from here ...
Ooh, I got one: if you miss him so much, why don't you marry him‌?
Close-up of Sokka and Katara with Aang in the foreground. We missed you so much!
But why would you agree to train someone from the Water Tribe‌?
What does it mean‌?
You know, I don't think there's such a thing as "space earth". If it's from space, then it's not really "earth".
I can't believe I missed you.
Cautiously. Aang, I know you're excited, She turns around to face him. but it's been a hundred years since you've been home.
Cautiously. It's just that ... a lot can change in all that time.
Uneasily. Aang, before we get to the temple, I want to talk to you about the airbenders.
Close-up of Katara. Well, I just want you to be prepared for what you might see. The Fire Nation is ruthless. Sadly. They killed my mother, and they could have done the same to your people.
Places one hand on Aang's shoulder. I know it's hard to accept.
Aang, it's amazing!
Irritated. You're lucky enough to be one of the first outsiders to ever visit an airbender temple, and all you can think about is food?
What's wrong?
Fire Nation.
Yelling. Aang! There's something you need to see.
Innocently holds her hands behind her back. Uh ... Just a new waterbending move I learned.
I can for Aang's sake. If he finds out that the Fire Nation invaded his home, he'll be devastated.
Understandingly places a hand on his shoulder. You must miss him.
Curious. Where are you going?
But Aang, no one could have survived in there for a hundred years.
Touching her chin with a finger. Good point.
Who are all these people?
Camera pans to the right. Katara points at the statue of a male dressed in Water Tribe clothes next to the airbender. And this one's a waterbender. Looks to the right and back to the left. They're lined up in a pattern: Points at the respective statues. air, water, earth and fire.
Understanding. Of course. They're Avatars. All these people are your past lives, Aang.
It's true. The picture pans up the reveal Aang staring at the statue of an elderly man with a beard. In the background hundreds of statues can be seen spiraling up. When the Avatar dies, he's reincarnated into the next nation in the cycle.
Aang! Snap out of it!
She curiously follows his gaze and looks at the statue as well. Who is that?
Looks at the base of the statue. There's no writing. How do you know his name?
Irritably. You're making a sound!
Worried. Aang!
Shouting above the raging winds. Close-up of the two siblings. Katara looks worried at her brother. What happened?
Oh no! It's his Avatar Spirit! Raises her hand to protect herself against the winds and the flying debris. He must have triggered it! I'm going to try and calm him down! Closes an eye against the wind and starts to make her way toward Aang.
In the background, Sokka is hunched over his rock, clenching his teeth together. Katara shouts calmly with a sad expression on her face. The camera slowly moves in on her. Aang! I know you're upset and I know how hard it is to lose the people you love. I went through the same thing when I lost my mom. Diverts her eyes. Shot switches to a frontal view of Aang, his tattoos glowing and wind swirling around him; his clothes flutter in the storm. Sokka runs over to his sister in the background. Monk Gyatso and the other airbenders may be gone, Close-up of her as she looks up at him. but you still have a family. Sokka and I! Sokka opens his eyes and glances at his sister. We're your family now!
It's okay. It wasn't your fault.
Everything's packed. You ready to go?
Maybe you'll find a way.
Aang approaches the duo. What are you going to name him?
Angrily. What are you doing?
Okay, I'm not crushed. You can get off me now!
Aang, there's no way we can fly out of here.
Turns around and suddenly grows angry. No! Walks up to her father. The Fire Nation can't separate our family again!
Sarcastically. Ha, ha.
Angrily. Yeah, no kidding. Walks away.
Turns around; furiously. Oh, everyone trusts you now! I was the first person to trust you! Places her left hand on her heart. Remember, back in Ba Sing Se. Points to the ocean. And you turned around and betrayed me, betrayed all of us!
Cuts to shot of her and Zuko standing on the cliff as she approaches him while snapping at him angrily. You really want to know? Hmm, maybe you could reconquer Ba Sing Se in the name of the Earth King. Cuts to side-view of her and Zuko. Or, I know! You could bring my mother back!
Angrily. You look terrible.
Brushing her hair. What do you want?
I need to borrow Appa.
Yes, it is.
We're going to find the man who took my mother from me.
Shakes her head in dismay. Ugh, I knew you wouldn't understand. Begins to walk away.
Angrily. Fine, maybe it is! Maybe that's what I need! Maybe that's what he deserves!
It's not the same! Jet attacked the innocent. This man, he's a monster.
Then you didn't love her the way I did!
Now that I know he's out there ... now that I know we can find him, I feel like I have no choice.
It's not just hard, it's impossible. Cuts to overhead shot of the field as she walks away, Zuko following behind.
Yes.
Don't try to stop us.
Thanks for understanding, Aang. Yip-yip. Appa takes flight; Aang and Sokka look up at the departing bison, their backs facing the camera.
Cuts to shot of the communication tower situated on an island in the middle of the ocean; off-camera. So once we find the communication tower, we bust in and take the information we need.
Cuts to shot of Zuko and Katara looking at the map. Whaletail Island, here we come.
Oh, don't you worry about my strength. I have plenty. I'm not the helpless little girl I was when they came.
Voice-over. I ran as fast as I could.
But we were too late. When we got there, the man was gone. Voice begins breaking. And so was she.
Clutches her necklace. I know.
Determined. Let's do this.
It's not him. She frees him from her grip. He's not the man.
That was him. That was the monster.
Do you know who I am?
Oh, you better remember me like your life depends on it! Why don't you take a closer look? Camera focuses on front view of her face.
She lied to you! Cut to a close-up of Katara who turns away from Yon Rha as she closes her eyes sadly. She was protecting the last waterbender!
Cut back to Katara who turns to face him again as she opens her eyes and looks back furiously. Me!
Sorrowfully. I always wondered what kind of person could do such a thing, but now that I see you, I think I understand. There's just nothing inside you, nothing at all. You're pathetic and sad and empty.
But as much as I hate you ... I just can't do it.
I'm doing fine.
I wanted to do it. I wanted to take out all my anger at him, but I couldn't. I don't know if it's because I'm too weak to do it or because I'm strong enough not to.
Rises from boardwalk. But I didn't forgive him. I'll never forgive him. Smiles at Zuko and walks up to him. But I am ready to forgive you.
Holding up two watermelons. Who wants a nice cool glass of watermelon juice?
What happened?
Worried. What's wrong with you? You could have hurt Aang!
The whole point of fighting the Fire Lord before the Comet was to stop the Fire Nation from winning the War, but they pretty much won the War when they took Ba Sing Se. Things can't get any worse.
Sinks to her knees. I can't believe this.
Aang, you don't have to do this alone.
Get over here, Zuko. Being part of the group also means being part of group hugs.
Actually, I used it all up after Azula shot you.
Holding a scroll. I have a surprise for everyone!
Uh, no. Everybody else starts eating again. I was looking for cooking pots in the attic, and I found this! Unravels the scroll showing a painting of a happy dark-haired baby playing at the beach. Look at baby Zuko. Isn't he cute?
To Zuko. Oh, lighten up. I'm just teasing.
Aang, we do understand. It's just ...
We're trying to help!
Aang, don't walk away from this. Walks toward Aang.
Maybe he was captured.
Then he's got to be somewhere on Ember Island. Let's split up and look for him.
Sokka, Appa didn't eat Momo. He's probably with Aang.
What should we do Zuko?
Well, you are kind of the expert on tracking Aang.
And the reason you've brought us to a seedy Earth Kingdom tavern is what now?
Angrily. I'm not his girlfriend!
Pulls out Aang's glider from Appa's saddle. I have Aang's staff.
Not just any old people. Walks up to Pakku. Side-view of the masters. These are great masters and friends of ours. Camera pans and zooms in on Katara and Pakku as she bows to Pakku. Pakku.
Frontal view. Surprised and overjoyed, as is Sokka behind her. That's so exciting! Frontal view of Pakku as she hugs Pakku. You and Gran-Gran must be so happy to have found each other again!
Zuko walks up to Jeong Jeong. And this was Aang's first firebending teacher.
Are you okay?
Close-up side-view of Zuko. Zuko, you're sorry for what you did, right?
Then he'll forgive you. He will.
It would be my pleasure.
Goodbye, General Iroh.
Zuko, don't worry. We can take Azula.
Somewhat confidently. Aang won't lose. He's gonna come back. Looks forward with narrowed eyes.  He has to. Close-up of Zuko's face as he follows Katara's lead and looks forward.
Jumps off of Appa to stand beside Zuko. And you're going down.
What are you doing? She's playing you. She knows she can't take us both, so she's trying to separate us.
But even you admitted to your uncle that you would need help facing Azula.
Yelling. Zuko!
I think I'm the one who should be thanking you.
That's very thoughtful of you, Sokka. Suddenly looks annoyed. Cuts to Sokka's painting, which is very unlike the group. Wait, why did you give me Momo's ears?
Voice-over. We need you, Aang.
Frontal shot of Aang with Katara behind him, looking at him in concern. Are you all right, Aang?
You seem to be having a lot of nightmares lately. You want to tell me about it?
Looking from the contents of the bag up to Aang. Well, we better smoothly fly She steps onto Appa's tail and walks to the saddle. ourselves to a market, 'cause we're out of food.
Shot cuts beside Sokka, facing out toward Katara and Aang, who turn to look at him; curious. What happened in your dream?
Shaking the watermelon, which emits an audible sloshing sound. I don't know if I like the sound of that swishing.
As the shot cuts to a frontal view of her, she puts the melon back on the stand. I just realized we're out of money anyway.
You could get a job, smart guy.
That's right. Katara and Aang smile.
Don't yell at him! Aang would never turn his back on anyone.
Aang is the bravest person I know. He's done nothing but help people and save lives since I met him. Behind Katara's back, Aang slowly begins to backpedal away from her. It's not his fault he disappeared, right Aang? Katara turns around to see Aang backing away. Aang, what's wrong?
You're a horrible old man! She gets on Appa, who is floating beside the dock. Appa, yip yip!
It's okay. That fisherman was way out of line.
Surprised. What do you mean?
It has to do with your dream, doesn't it? Puts her hand on his shoulder. Talk to me.
I'm going to try to get a little fire going.
So you were upset that you were the Avatar? Why wouldn't you be excited about it?
That's awful, Aang. I don't know what to say.
Whoa! Hot cinders!
You have the right to be angry after the monks sent you away like that.
You ran away.
You don't know what would have-.
Aang ...
You're being too hard on yourself, even if you did run away. I think it was meant to be. If you had stayed, you would have been killed along with all the other airbenders.
I know it was meant to be this way. The world needs you now. You give people hope.
Grabs lady and brings her near the fire. It's okay. You're safe.
What do you mean? Where's Sokka?
I'm going with you!
Where are they?
Really?
I don't think you're gonna have those nightmares anymore.
Moving to the front of the saddle. Is something wrong?
I don't know. There's something ominous about that place.
Pointing blandly. Sokka, you've got an elbow leech.
Crosses her arms; sarcastically. Where do you think?
You couldn't find them?
Maybe you should listen to Aang. Something about this place feels ... alive.
Yelling. Appa! Momo!
What was that?
Does anyone else get the feeling that we're being watched?
Calling out. Aang! Sokka!
Hello? Hello? Can you help me? She squints. Mom? More loudly and running toward the figure. Mom!
I can't believe ...
She has not moved, although her hand is on her head as she sits on the root they have fallen onto. Well, I've been wandering around looking for you!
What girl?
I thought I saw Mom.
Surprised. You saw something too?
Okay ... so where's here? The middle of the swamp?
So, who are you then?
She and her friends are now sitting, listening to Huu. But what did our visions mean?
Hey, you guys are waterbenders!
Smiling. Sokka is shown chewing nonchalantly next to her. The South Pole.
No, it's all ice and snow.
What about the visions?
Toph! Aren't you gonna get ready for the day?
You're not gonna wash up? You've got a little dirt on your ... everywhere, actually.
Hmm ... Thinking. You know what we need? A girl's day out!
It'll be fun!
Are you ready for some serious pampering?
I'm glad. It's about time we did something fun together.
Don't listen to them, let's just keep walking.
Angrily. Let's go, Toph.
Now that was funny.
Those girls don't know what they're talking about.
That's what I really admire about you, Toph. You're so strong, and confident, and self-assured. Toph sniffs. And I know it doesn't matter, but ... Keeps her palm on Toph's shoulder. You're really pretty.
Yeah, you are.
Ow!
Nonchalantly, still focusing on her task at hand. That's great, Aang.
Looks over Aang and attempts to show enthusiasm. That's great!
Close side-view shot of Katara as she casts her brother an annoyed glare; irritably. What does me being a girl have to do with sewing?
Suddenly smiles. Sarcastically. All done with your pants! Shows that the pants are still ripped. And look what a great job I did!
Cut to close frontal view of Aang who is looking at something, his hand held against his brow. The siblings stand in the background. He's right. At this rate, we won't get to the North Pole until spring.
Cut to Katara who enthusiastically waves back. Whooh!
Smiling. He looks pretty good out there.
Notices something behind Sokka and runs off screen. No, Appa. Don't eat that! Appa grunts.
Worried. What's wrong?
Get out of there!
What was that thing?
Leans forward in her bonds. Pleading and apologetically. No, don't hurt him! He didn't mean it. My brother is just an idiot sometimes. Suki released Sokka, but still stares at him in dismay.
Nervously. Aang ... do some airbending.
Puts down the orange dessert, accepts the dessert Aang offers her and takes a bit. Well, maybe just a bite.
Glancing amusingly at Aang. Slightly mocking. He's just upset because a bunch of girls kicked his butt yesterday.
Mockingly looks at her brother. Right. And then they kicked your butt.
Hey, don't get too comfortable. It's risky for us to stay in one place for very long.
Well, it's nice to see you excited about being the Avatar. Slightly concerned. I just hope it doesn't all go to your head.
Turns around in surprise, but is happy to see that the poke came from Aang. Oh, good! Can you help me carry this back to the room? She moves the pot toward Aang. It's a little heavy.
Slightly irritated. What do you mean, "you can't?"
Resumed filling the pot with more vegetables. Watching you show off for a bunch of girls does not sound like fun.
Annoyed. It's not my basket. These supplies are for our trip. I told you, we have to leave Kyoshi soon.
Slightly mocking. Aangy ...
Sarcastic. "Simple monk", huh? Annoyed. I thought you promised me that this Avatar stuff wouldn't go to your head.
Close-up; angrily. Jealous? More high pitched voice. Of what?
Irritated. That's ridiculous.
Turning away; irritated. Urch!
Slants up her eyes in annoyance, which Aang can't see while continuing to practice her bending. Yeah.
Still not looking at Aang; disinterested. Good for you.
Still disinterested. Nope. Have fun.
Growing irritated again. Great.
Irritated. I'm glad you know.
Angry. Good! She loses control over the water and it splashed back into the bowl. Katara balls her fists in annoyance.
Somewhat concerned. I wanted to make sure you were safe. You really had me worried.
In a regretful voice. I'm sorry.
Smiling. Puts her hands beside her mouth, yelling in a joking manner. Well, get out of the water before you catch a cold, you big jerk!
Worried. Hang on, Aang!
Aang!
Carefully peeking over the rock. Zuko!
Worriedly. Wake up, Aang!
Get inside.
It's not your fault.
Then let's get out of here. Zuko will leave Kyoshi to follow us. I know it feels wrong to run, but I think it's the only way.
Peeking over the rim of the saddle to address a saddened Aang. Sokka is wiping of the face paint with his sleeve. I know it's hard, but you did the right thing. Gesturing toward the town. Zuko would have destroyed the whole place if we had stayed. Comforting. They're going to be okay, Aang.
Shocked; off-camera. What are you doing?
Smiling as Aang sits down. Yes, it was.
Waving her hands up and down while shifting looks between Aang and Sokka. Look, we're all just a little tired and cranky because we've been flying for two days straight.
They're waterbenders! Happily. We found the Water Tribe!
In awe. The Northern Water Tribe.
Fascinated. I can't believe how many waterbenders live up here!
This place is beautiful.
Hopping in on the conversation; teasingly. Ha, prince of what?
Sarcastically. My apologies, Prince Sokka.
Very smooth ...
Excitedly. I've waited for this day my whole life. I finally get to learn from a real waterbending master!
Angrily. What do you mean you won't teach me? I didn't travel across the entire world so you could tell me no!
But there must be other female waterbenders in your tribe!
I don't want to heal, I want to fight!
Furious. Well, your rules stink!
Wait! Aang didn't mean that! Goes to Aang. You can't risk your training for me. You have to learn from Master Pakku, even if he is a big jerk.
Uhhh ... Hi. Are you Yugoda?
Looks at all the young girls, and speaks in a disappointed tone. I guess I am.
Thanks for the lesson.
Huh?
Shocked. Ah ... No. I don't think I'm ready for that yet. My grandmother gave my mother this necklace and my mother passed it down to me.
Confused. Wait, how do you know my Gran-Gran's name?
She never told me.
If Gran-Gran was engaged, why did she leave?
How's warrior training going? Sokka kicks his bag.
Excited. Why didn't I think of that? At night, you can teach me whatever moves you learn from Master Pakku! That way, you have someone to practice with, and I get to learn waterbending! Everyone's happy!
But you're never happy. Come on, Aang.
Bending the water. I got it!
That wasn't me.
Yes ... please!
Fine.
No. Begins cracking the ice inadvertently. No way am I apologizing to a sour old man like you! Two pots shatter.
I'll be outside if you're man enough to fight me.
Takes off her coat. I know! I don't care!
I'm not doing it for you! Someone needs to slap some sense into that guy! Pakku comes down. So, you decided to show up? Pakku walks away. Aren't you going to fight?
Determined. You can't knock me down!
But you still won't teach me, will you?
Come back here. I'm not finished yet!
No, it's not. It's mine! Give it back!
Unfreezing the ice; surprised. My Gran-Gran was supposed to marry you?
But she didn't love you, did she? It was an arranged marriage. Gran-Gran wouldn't let your tribe's stupid customs run her life. That's why she left. It must have taken a lot of courage.
You, too.
Grabs Aang's arm. Calm down, it's going to be okay. Aang sits down in front of her. If you want, I can try to teach you some of the stuff I know.
Nods and looks over the side of Appa's saddle. We'll need to find a good source of water first.
Somewhat blankly. Remember the reason we're here.
This is a pretty basic move, but it still took me months to perfect. So don't get frustrated if you don't get it right away. She moves her hands back and forth and makes small waves in the water, while Aang looks up, smiling. Just push and pull the water like this. The key is getting the wrist movement right.
Kindly. That's almost right. If you keep practicing I'm sure eventually—
Surprised. Wow, I can't believe you got that so quickly. It took me two months to learn that move.
Smiles. Thanks.
This is a more difficult move. I call it streaming the water. She moves her hands and raises a stream of water from the river into the air and moves it around. It's harder than it looks, so don't be disappointed if- Shows Aang already controlling a stream of water, moving it around and above his body and neatly coiling it back into the river, much to Katara's dismay. Nice work. She frowns. Though the over-the-head flare was unnecessary.
Looks up sadly. Well I kind of know this one other move, but it's pretty hard. I haven't even totally figured it out yet. The idea is to create a big, powerful wave. She moves her hands up, shaking, and starts to get a big mass of water to rise out of the river, but it pops before forming into anything substantial.
Angry at Aang's quick success. That's enough practicing for today.
No offense Aang, but I'll hold the money from now on. Aang hands her the two copper coins.
Smiling. Look at this, Aang. It's a waterbending scroll! Aang walks over. Check out these crazy moves.
So, how much for the, uh, traded scroll?
Whispering. Aang, can we get out of here? I feel like we're getting weird looks.
Worried, holding her arms. I'll just feel a lot better once we get away from here.
Scared. I don't think these pirates are here to trade with us. Turns around and runs, Aang and Sokka follow and the pirates chase behind them. Half of the group runs down one street while the other goes down the one next to it.
Aang! I thought we were running away from the pirates! Jumps on to Aang's glider with Sokka and they lift off into the air.
Mischievously. I know. That's why I took this. Holds out the waterbending scroll they saw in the shop.
Excited. Isn't it great?
Jokingly. I prefer to think of it as high risk trading.
Sokka, where do you think they got it? They stole it from a waterbender!
These are real waterbending forms. You know how crucial it is for Aang to learn waterbending!
I just want to try this one move first and then it's all yours. Gives it to Aang. Here, hold it open for me. The single water whip. Looks doable. Attempts the move, but ends up hitting herself in the forehead. Ow!
Glaring at Sokka. What's so funny?
Angrily. Aang will get his turn once I figure out the water whip. She tries again, but hits Momo instead, who screeches. Ugh, why can't I get this stupid move?
Screaming. Will you please shut your air hole? Believe it or not your infinite wisdom gets a little old sometimes! Why don't we just throw the scroll away since you're so naturally gifted! Sokka glares at her. What? She looks back at Aang, who has tears in his eyes. Oh my gosh, Aang, I am so sorry, I don't know what came over me. But you know what, it won't happen again. She gives the scroll to Aang. Here, this is yours. I don't want to have anything to do with it anymore.
Bends down to pet Momo as he rubs his hind end. I'm sorry, Momo.
No more apologies!
Whispering. Shhh, Momo! Go back to sleep. Shh! The camera fades to show her standing by the river, attempting but failing to perfect the water whip, frustrated. Ugh, ugh, ugh! Shoot! Come on water, work with me here! Okay, what if I just, ow! Stupid scroll! The pirate captain and Zuko are shown hearing her. Okay Katara, shift your weight through the stances. She drops the water again and hears the ship pulling up onto the river bank. She peaks through the bushes to see what the noise was, and gasps upon seeing the pirates. She turns to run, but it grabbed by a pirate. No! Let go of me! She bends water up into the pirate's face, and he releases her, she runs but is grabbed again on the wrists by Zuko.
Furiously. Go jump in the river!
My mother's necklace! How did you get that?
No!
Aang, this is all my fault.
Thanks, Momo. I owe you a bushel of apples. She runs to join the fight. Aang is shown lost in the smoke, a thrown knife narrowly misses him and cuts through his ropes. Zuko finds his way out of the smoke cloud and hides the scroll behind his back, but the pirate captain sees him and the two begin to fight. The scroll flies into the air and his caught by Momo, the iguana parrot sees him and hits Momo. The scroll flies back down to the ground. A knife narrowly misses Sokka's head, and he uses it to cuts the ropes on his hands.
Help me get this boat back in the water so we can get outta here. They join her in trying to push the boat, but can't.
Everybody in!
I couldn't have done it without your help.
Pointing. Aang, look! The ship is shown headed toward a huge waterfall.
We can stop the boat! Aang, together, push and pull the water! They create a small Whirlpool that stops the boat. It's working, it's slowing down! We're doing it!
Aang, I still owe you an apology. You were just so good at waterbending without really trying. I got so competitive that I put us all in danger, I'm sorry.
Besides, who needs that stupid scroll anyway?
The scroll!
Stealing is wrong. Snatches scroll. Unless it's from pirates.
This is humiliating.
Looking at him momentarily before answering. Both.
Uhhh ... I think your feet need their eyes checked.
You guys go. I think we need to talk about some things.
We need to decide what we're gonna do now, and since you're the Avatar, maybe you should be a part of this.
Aang, no one said it's going to be easy.
We could look for Jeong Jeong!
Aang, can we talk about you learning firebending now?
You can't possibly think that any of us would trust you, can you? I mean, how stupid do you think we are?!
Or when you stole my mother's necklace and used it to track us down and capture us?
You need to get out of here. Now.
No, we won't! Blasts water at him. Get out of here, and don't come back! And if we ever see you again, well, we'd better not see you again!
Why would he try to fool us like that?
This is just like when we were in prison together at Ba Sing Se. He starts talking about his mother and making it seem like he's an actual human being with feelings.
The thing is, it worked. I did feel sorry for him. I felt like he was really confused and hurt, but obviously, when the time came, he made his choice, and we paid the price. We can't trust him.
Sokka, I looked at it, and I told you, there was nothing there!
No way! I'm sure he only did it so he could capture you himself!
And what was all that crazy stuff about setting Appa free? What a liar!
Sarcastically. You're right, Toph! Let's go find him and give him a medal. The "not as much of a jerk as you could have been" award!
Easy for you to say! You weren't there when he had us attacked by pirates!
Why would you even try to defend him?
Well, I guess that settles that.
Handing a bowl to The Duke. Has anyone seen Toph?
I think we should go look for her.
Approaching, with Sokka and Aang. Worried. Toph! What happened?
Oh no, what happened?
I meant, how.
Zuko?
It's gonna take a while for your feet to get better. Stops healing. I wish I could have worked on them sooner.
Following. Sarcastically. You are a master of surprise, Sokka ...
I can't step out to waterbend at him without being blown up and I can't get a good enough angle on him from down here.
Glares at Zuko for a moment and Zuko starts to sweat; reluctantly. I'll go along with whatever you think is right. Aang smiles.
You might have everyone else here buying your ... transformation, but you and I both know you've struggled with doing the right thing in the past. Approaches him; threateningly. So let me tell you something, right now. You make one step backward, Close-up of Zuko. one slip-up, give me one reason to think you might hurt Aang, and you won't have to worry about your destiny anymore. Close-up of Katara's angry face. Because I'll make sure your destiny ends ... right then and there. Permanently.
Voice-over; somewhat dreamily. Those clouds look so soft, Cut to Aang sitting lazily atop Appa's head, a twig in his mouth; the view pans to the left, showing Sokka carving something with an uninterested look on his face, Katara lying on her stomach, popped up on her elbows, staring dreamingly over the rim of Appa's saddle, and Momo sleeping on the luggage. don't they? Like you could just jump down and you'd land in a big, soft, cottony heap?
Looks at Sokka with annoyance; sarcastically as she looks away from him. You're hilarious.
Hey, what is that?
Aang? Are you okay?
Shhh!
Aang, you didn't let this happen. It has nothing to do with you.
That's why we're going to the North Pole. Smiling softly. To find you a teacher.
Approaches Aang. Hey, Aang! You ready to be cheered up?
These acorns are everywhere, Aang. That means the forest will grow back! Every one of these will be a tall oak tree someday, and all the birds and animals that lived here will come back. She places the acorn in his hand and closes it.
What happens then?
Hey great bridge guy, could I talk to you over here for a second? She leads him toward a window. Aang, you seem a little unsure about all of this.
So ... can you help these people?
With a kind and reassuring smile. I think you can do it, Aang.
Aang will figure out the right thing to do, Sokka.
Sokka, wait! Starts to follow him.
Running to the village entrance. Sokka! The villagers go the entrance as well. Katara is left standing fearful.
I know.
Everything's going to be okay ...
It's okay, Appa, don't worry. I'm sure they're on their way back. I bet they even found you a bunch of moon peaches for a treat. The two return the village.
It's no use, Appa. I don't seem them anywhere. Our best hope is to go back to the village and wait. She re-directs Appa to the village's direction.
You're back! She embraces Aang. Where's Sokka?
Aang, what are you doing?! Run!
Sokka! She runs to him and embraces him, while other villagers embrace their loved ones.
You were trapped in the Spirit World for 24 hours! How are you feeling?
Sokka!
I'm so proud of you, Aang. You figured out what to do, all on your own.
That's great!
But the solstice is tomorrow!
Desperately. Please don't go Aang. The world can't afford to lose you to the Fire Nation. Closer shot of Katara's pleading face. Neither can I.
We're not letting you go into the Fire Nation, Aang.
Looking back to Zuko's ship. Aang. We've got trouble!
Yelling. Fireball!
Aang, Katara, and Sokka all make faces and grasp their noses. We have to get out of Zuko's range, before he shoots another hot stinker at us!
There's no time!
And that's exactly why we're here.
Smiles sweetly and approaches Appa. Rubs his belly. Aww, you must be tired.
Props hand off hip. Responds dryly. I was talking to Appa.
Camera drops to show the group taking cover behind a lower wall below steps. The Fire Nation must have abandoned the temple when Avatar Roku died.
That's when we were at the Air Temple. Avatar Roku's eyes were glowing there, too!
Aang tugs at the door uselessly. Can't you just open them with firebending? Like you opened that other door?
Impressed. You've really outdone yourself this time, Sokka.
Hides behind a column with her brother. Holds Momo. Glances to the next column where Aang hides. It's almost sunset. Are you ready?
Presses forward. Seizes Aang's arm. Aang! Stop! Relaxes, releasing his arm. There's nothing else we can do ...
A moment passes. Sudden excitement. Sokka, you're a genius!
You're right. Sokka's plan didn't work. But it looks like it did.
A moment of silence. Aang! Now's your chance!
Chained. Sees him coming toward her. Turns head toward the closing door. Go!
Pleased. He made it!
Worried. How's Aang gonna make it out of this?
Sokka struggles against his chains. Katara is terrified. No! Aang!
Not without Aang!
 Walking away with Sokka, helping Aang. I don't know.
