Wait, let me see that. The Kyoshi Warrior hands the clump of fur to her. No, it couldn't be. The camera pans up to show Appa's trail of fur on the cliff. Suki follows the trail and gasps when she reaches the top. Appa? Oh, no. Close-up of Appa, who backs away into the passage in fear as Suki walks up. She stops and kneels down, putting several berries and an apple on the ground. It's gonna be okay, Appa. Stands up and back away. I have to leave, but I'm gonna be back soon with help.
No sudden movements. He's been lost for a while and he looks like he's hurt. Closer shot of the Kyoshi Warriors. He's shy around people and scared. Stay low and stay quiet.
Yes, so he can't be too far from here. Walking up the hill. It's our responsibility to get Appa back to him safely. This could be our most important mission yet. The Kyoshi Warriors peer over the top of the hill at Appa, who growls and shakes his head at the intruders. Give him some space! The other Kyoshi Warriors take a step back. Suki takes a step forward. Appa, it's me, Suki. I'm a friend. Appa growls and Suki slowly approaches Appa. I want to help you. You're hurt. We can help you feel better. Appa growls in response. And we can help you find Aang. Appa softly growls and Suki places her hands Appa's nose and Appa lies down with Suki kneeling in front.
What do you want with us?
If you're looking for the Avatar, you're out of luck.
Unsheathes her sword. Go, Appa! Fly away from here!
Get out of here! You have to find Aang! We'll be okay!
Sits up; aggressively. What is it? Did I do something wrong?
Close-up. She averts her eyes; bitterly. You people all look the same to me.
Sokka! Runs up to him; cut to a side-view. It's you!
No. I don't know where they are. They locked me in here because I'm the leader.
Frontal shot. I'm so glad Places her hand over Sokka's on her face and closes her eyes. to see you Sokka. Opens them again. I knew you'd come.
Actually, we met a long time ago.
Somewhat angrily. Yeah, you kind of burned down my village.
Just get to the point, Sokka.
But how are you going to get the cooler out?
To Sokka. I guess we have no choice.
Approaching. Your dad?
I'm not leaving without you, Sokka.
We had to. Holds Sokka's hand.
Comforting. I'm sorry, Sokka.
Sokka, what's going on?
That's great.
What?
Takes his hands off her shoulders. We'll never make it onto the gondola. There's too many guards.
Okay, let's say by some miracle this all works and we make it on the gondola. The warden will still just cut the lines, even if we have a captive.
Okay. But how do we do that?
Ties his hands together and uses his headband as a gag. Sorry, warden. You're my prisoner now. Slams the warden against the wall; the rest of the escapees arrive. We've got the warden! Now let's get out of here!
We're almost there!
Everyone in!
We're on our way!
Determined. This is a rematch I've been waiting for.
Well, we made it out. Now what?
Cut to close-up of her and Sokka. We were just in town and we found this poster! Sokka shows the poster for the play to the team. It depicts Katara, Aang, and Sokka with Zuko's scarred face in the background.
"Brought to you by the critically acclaimed Ember Island Players."
Laughs. You never told me you made out with a Moon Spirit.
Hint of sarcasm. Yeah, you tell bad jokes about plenty of other topics.
It seems like every time there's a big battle, you guys barely make it out alive. I mean, you guys lose a lot!
Looks at Sokka seriously. Are you trying to get on my bad side?
Seriously. I'm an elite warrior who's trained for many years in the art of stealth. Smiling. I think I could get you backstage! Sokka and Suki leave.
He's coming this way!
Wait, the play's not over!
Horrible.
Swats away Yue's hearts and pulls out her fans at Yue. I saw him first.
Tickets and passports please.
Yeah, I got a problem with you! I've seen your type before. Probably sarcastic, think you're hilarious and let me guess, you're traveling with the Avatar.
You mean you don't remember? Maybe you'll remember this! Kisses Sokka on the cheek.
Sokka, it's good to see you!
That crabby lady makes all the security guards wear them. And look at you, sleeveless guy. Been working out?
Yeah. After you left Kyoshi, we wanted to find a way to help people. We ended up escorting some refugees and we've been here ever since. Momo jumps up next to her. Hi, Momo! Good to see you too! Scratches his head near his ear. So why are you guys getting tickets for the ferry? Wouldn't you just fly across on Appa?
I'm so sorry to hear that. To Aang. Are you doing okay?
In her normal Kyoshi Warrior attire. I'm coming too!
Sokka, I thought you'd want me to come.
Just what?
The Fire Nation controls the western lake. Rumor has it they're working on something big on the other side of it and don't want anyone to find out what it is.
Sokka, I'm fine, stop worrying!
It's a beautiful moon.
Look, I know you're just trying to help, but I can take care of myself.
Then why are you acting so overprotective?
I lost someone I care about. He didn't die, he just went away. I only had a few days to get to know him, but he was smart and brave and funny ...
No, he's about your height.
It is you, stupid!
I'm sorry.
Just because I live near the unagi doesn't mean I'm an expert!
Actually, it's me.
Sokka, it's been really great to see you again.
I came along because I wanted to make sure you got through the Serpent's Pass safely. But now I need to get back to the other Kyoshi Warriors.
Listen, I'm really sorry about last night. We were talking ... and saying things ... and I just got carried away and before I knew it -
Um, there's an awful lot of fire in that general direction ...
Embarrassed. Oops, wrong tent!
Nope, not me! Walks away.
Lounging on stairs with Sokka. Come on, Zuko. Just take a break. What's the big deal?
Sitting on a beach towel. I think it's sweet.
But he looks so sweet and innocent.
So, he went for a midnight swim and never came back?
Off-camera. Mole? Her skin is flawless.
Cut to over-head view from behind the masters. So wait. How do you all know each other?
Amazed. Wow! You took back your whole city all by yourself!
Side-view of Suki and Katara. That's why you gathered the members of the White Lotus.
It's weird to say, but the comet actually looks beautiful.
Approaches the steering wheel. What are we going to do about the rest of the crew?
Sadly. No ...
What just happened‌?
Shouldn't we be helping him?
Responding to Sokka's last comment. Then what?
I'm okay! Just finish the mission!
Pointing to the exhausted Ozai while approaching him. So did you, you know ... finish the job?
Patheically. Yeah! Or how about King of the ... Guys Who ... Don't Win?
It's okay. She's one of us now. Sokka turns to Ty Lee before turning back to Suki, with a stunned look for both.
And why did you paint me firebending?
Voice-over. And if you don't answer all our questions, we're throwing you back in the water with Unagi.
Stepping forward, gesturing heavily with her clenched fist. Indignantly. There were no men. We ambushed you. Now tell us, who are you and what are you doing here?
Grabs Sokka by his collar. Angrily. A bunch of girls, huh? Unagi is gonna eat well tonight.
Not convinced by Aang's statement. Shaking her fist to emphasize her words. That's impossible! The last Avatar was an airbender who disappeared a hundred years ago.
Looks at how Sokka continues his warm up. Well, you're in the right place. Cut to a side-view while Sokka is loosening up his hips. Sorry about yesterday. I didn't know that you were friends with the Avatar.
Sarcastically. I should hope so. A big strong man like you? We wouldn't stand a chance.
Keeps using sarcasm without Sokka catching on to it. Leans slightly toward Sokka. Wow! Best warrior, huh? Glances back to the other Kyoshi Warriors. In your whole village? Looks back to Sokka. Maybe you'd be kind enough to give us a little demonstration.
Turns to the other warriors. Come on, girls! Wouldn't you like him to show us some moves?
Close-up of Suki's confident face. Of course.
Mockingly. Anything else you want to teach us?
Hostile. Hoping for another dance lesson?
Close-up of Suki; hostile. Spit it out! What do you want?
Frog view of Suki; hostile. Even if I'm a girl?
Cut to a side-view of the two; Suki has her arms crossed while looking down upon Sokka. We normally don't teach outsiders, let alone boys.
Frog view; on a friendlier tone. All right. But you have to follow all of our traditions.
Smiling. And I mean all of them.
It's a warrior's uniform, you should be proud. Closeup of Sokka, the camera pans down to reveal the entire uniform close by. The silk threads symbolize the brave blood that flows through our veins. The gold insignia represents the honor of the warrior's heart.
You're not going to master it in one day. Even I'm not that good.
Peeks her head around the door to look at the hit tree before turning back to Sokka. Friendly. It's not about strength. Our technique is about using your opponents' force against them. Loosen up. Retracts her own fan from her belt and points it at Sokka, who takes on a battle position. Think of the fan as an extension of your arm. Close-up of Sokka. Wait for an opening and then ...
Quickly gets up; irritated. I fell on purpose to make you feel better!
Okay, it was a lucky shot. Releases the finger while smiling broadly. On a more serious tone. Let's see if you can do it again.
Smiling while impressed. Not bad.
There's no time to say goodbye.
Surprised. For what?
Side-view. I am a warrior. She leans over and kisses Sokka on the cheek, before continuing again. A surprised Sokka touches his cheek where Suki just kissed him. But I'm a girl, too. Cut to shot of Sokka who blushes; cut to Suki who stands in the alleyway, her fan slid open to fight. Now get out of here! We'll hold them off.
