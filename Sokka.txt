Raises his forefinger. As a matter of fact, they do not.
Shrugging. Then what was the point?
Well, scientifically speaking, there's no way to prove that ...
Angrily. What are you doing in my mouth? Momo chitters happily while lying upside down on Sokka's belly, chewing on the fly he "rescued" from the spider's web. Momo, you need to be a little more sensitive to my boundaries.
Crawling toward Appa. Come on! Come on! Come on!
Stretching out his arm over the saddle as if he wants to grab it. Wait, my boomerang!
Annoyed. Oh, I see, Turning to Katara. so there's time to get your scrolls Turning toward Aang. and time to get your staff, Looking back at Katara with his hand on his chest. but no time for my boomerang?
Bowing his head in defeat by this totally honest answer. Oh.
Sadly. I feel like I've lost part of my identity. He jumps up and moves Aang's hat slightly so that he can point at Aang's arrow. Imagine if you lost your arrow, or Katara lost her ... Makes a hair loopies gesture with a somewhat bored look. hair loopies.
He picks up the basket full of supplies, looking dejected at the nickname. I used to be boomerang guy ...
And here comes Avatar Roku! Roku effigy rolls by.
And it's nice to appreciate their deep-fried festival food! He takes a huge bite out of the food-item he is holding.
Now a torch, that's a nice prop. It's bright, dangerous ... Sniffs. smells manly. But I'm not sure I could carry it off.
So some people don't like you, big deal! There's a whole nation of firebenders who hate you. Now let's bust you out of here!
Upbeat. Sure you can! A little Theatrically jumps back and pretends to airbend by blowing air. Katara looks ashamed for her brother. He moves to the back of the room to "cut" the air. swish-swish-swish! He makes a grotesque movement with his arm before thrusting his face in the camera. Airbending slice! He resumes his place beside Katara, who is still looking annoyed by her brother. He makes a circular motion with his hands and points toward the door. And we're on our way!
How're we gonna to do that? The crime happened over three hundred years ago.
Content. Well, I guess I could be classified as such.
Bragging. Everyone wanted to blame it on the polar leopard, but I figured out it was Old Man Jarko wearing polar leopard boots! Katara holds her hand to her brow, annoyed by Sokka's monologue. See, a real eight hundred-pound polar leopard would have left much deeper tracks. Aang is making fun of Sokka, Katara holds her hand to her mouth to refrain herself from bursting out in laughs. Okay, I guess I am pretty good.
Pretends to ponder about the question. Katara stares at him, trying to figure out what he is doing. Fine! But I'm going to need some new props. The camera spins around. When it stops again, Sokka is wearing a hat with a monocle. I'm ready. Katara looks surprised at his new outfit and giggles. Sokka extends his monocle to investigate her. What?
This temple and this statue were cut from the same stone. Runs back over to the statue. And we know that the statue was built after Chin died.
Shouting. Shhh! I wanna solve it! Pointing at the temple. That means Kyoshi never set foot in this temple!
You're right. Blows soap bubbles with his dragon shaped pipe, while thinking about their next course of action. We need to go to Kyoshi Island.
They say it was Kyoshi.
With feigned casualness. So, uh ... what's Suki up to? Is she around?
He disappointedly slants his eyes. Oh, well ... that's great.
These fans ... He picks up one of the fans and waves it back and forth. They were her weapons, no?
Annoyed. Special outfit? Hat and pipe? These things mean anything to you?
Dramatically raises his hand in the air. Aha! Showing his own boots to Oyaji. There's no way Kyoshi could have made that footprint. Moves toward Katara to explain everything to her. And therefore there is nothing linking her to the crime scene.
Sokka spins around in shock, spitting out some of the bubbles he swallowed. Very surprised. Three hundred and seventy years? Wait, He grabs Oyaji by his collar. are you sure it was today?
Staring at the painting again. This ceremony didn't take place at sunrise. It took place at sunset. Addresses Katara. Look at the shadows.
Shoves Katara out of the way as she yelps. If Kyoshi was in the ceremony at sunset, she couldn't have been in Chin committing the crime. She has an alibi! Points his pipe dramatically toward the camera upon making his conclusion.
Raises his hand before his mouth to say some quiet, encouraging words. You can do it, Aang. Just remember the evidence.
Whispers. The footprint!
Mumbles to Katara while they continue to smile. He's dead.
Whispering. What are you doing?
Plays with his magnifying glass. I do believe in the power of stuff.
Raises his arms in the air and exclaims ecstatically. Boomerang! You do always come back!
Looks questioningly into his bowl. What is this?
Stares skeptically at his dough-cookie. This is by far the worst town we've ever been to.
Angrily. I knew it! Accusingly points a finger at Aang as he and Katara draw closer. You signaled the Fire Navy with that flare! You're leading them straight to us, aren't you?
Angry and triumphant, having found an excuse. Aha! The traitor confesses! Warriors, away from the enemy. The children begin to sadly walk away. The foreigner is banished from our village.
Stubbornly persisting in his anger. No, I'm keeping my promise to Dad. Pointing to Aang. I'm protecting you, from threats like him!
Annoyed. Fun?! We can't fight firebenders with fun!
Angrily. Get out of our village! Now!
Demanding. Where do you think you're going?
Katara! Would you really choose him over your tribe? Shows shot of the entire Southern Water Tribe. Your own family?
Sarcastically, with arms crossed. Let's see your bison fly now, air boy.
Mockingly. Yeah, I thought so!
All right, ready our defenses! The Fire Nation could be on our shores any moment now!
Authoritatively, a twinge of annoyance in his voice; he points onward, ushering the boy in that direction. And no potty breaks!
Disappointed at the tower's collapse. Oh man!
Horrified. Oh maaan ...
Moodily. Hi, Aang. Thanks for coming.
Bewildered. No way!
Katara, I --
Cutting her off. Katara! Slightly annoyed. Are you gonna talk all day, or are you comin' with me?
Inviting. Get in, we're going to save your boyfriend.
Shrugging, nonchalant. Whatever.
Kanna hugs Sokka, who, slightly embarrassed, pats her back. Yeah, okay Gran. He smiles broadly when she releases him.
Annoyed. You just looove taking me out of my comfort zone, don't you?
Unamused. Go. Fly. Katara glances annoyed at her brother. Soar.
Blandly. Up. Ascend. Elevate.
What was it that kid said? Yee-haw? Hup-hup? Wah-hoo? Uh ... Yip-yip?
Ecstatically looking over the rim of the saddle. He's flying! He's flying! Katara, he's -
Sheepishly. I mean, big deal. He's flying. Brightens quickly.
Impressed. Now that was some waterbending!
Well, I couldn't let you have all the glory.
Rising. Got it!
Triumphantly. Ha! That's from the Water Tribe!
Complaining. Katara!
Muttering to himself, as he uses his boomerang to chip the ice. I'm just a guy, with a boomerang. He frees his left foot. I didn't ask for all this flying and magic! He manages to break free and races up Appa's tail. Yip-yip! Yip-yip!
Content. I'd like that. I'd reeally like that.
Rises to view their destination. There it is!
Viewing the display. Not bad, not bad.
But sir, the thing is, Aang can only do those things when he's in the Avatar State.
Resting on his bed with his arms behind his head. Why not? Remember when he took out the Fire Navy? Widens his eyes. He was incredible!
Casually. Or just glow it up and stop that Fire Lord!
Sitting on the floor, tired out by Aang's actions. I guess he could talk the Fire Lord to death.
Maybe I can shock you into the Avatar State.
Huh?
You sure?
Nonchalantly. Okay.
What can he say? You're the Avatar. Who knows better than you?
Aang! Attempts to come to his aid, only to be held down by two soldiers.
The general's gone crazy! He's trying to force Aang into the Avatar State!
Approaching the ostrich horse carefully. Good ... bird ... horse thingy ...
Riding the ostrich horse. Katara! No!
Anybody got a problem with that?
Hugs Aang; is disguised as a Fire Nation guard. Aang, good to see you back with the living, buddy!
After what happened at Ba Sing Se, we had to get you to safety. We flew back to Chameleon Bay where we found my father and the other Water Tribe men. Flashback preparing to leave by taking off his Earth King robes revealing traveling robes beneath. The Earth King decided he wanted to travel the world in disguise, so he set off alone. Bosco is shown taking off his own attire and hat before Kuei jumps on Bosco and they set off. Well, not completely alone. Cut back to Sokka continuing the story. Soon, the bay was overrun by Fire Nation ships. Rather than fight them all, we captured a single ship and made it our disguise. Since then we've been traveling west. We crossed through the Serpent's Pass a few days ago. We've seen a few Fire Nation ships, but none have bothered us.
So we're planning a smaller invasion. Just a ragtag team of our friends and allies from around the Earth Kingdom. We already ran into Pipsqueak and The Duke.
And the best part is, the eclipse isn't even our biggest advantage! Whispers. We have a secret... Looks at both of his sides.Â You!
Yep, the whole world thinks you're dead! Isn't that great? Stands up and raises both of his fists triumphantly.
Approaching Aang. No, it's great! It means the Fire Nation won't be hunting us anymore! And even better, they won't be expecting you on the Day of Black Sun!
Following. Aang, no! Grabs the staff. You're still hurt, and you have to stay secret! Just let us handle this.
Things couldn't get much worse. A serpent rises from the water near their ship. Sokka turns around and looks at it in despar. Yelling. The universe just loves proving me wrong, doesn't it?
Thank you, the universe!
Here, Offering a Fire Nation bandana. tie this around your head. It will cover your arrow.
Aang, come on. Be practical.
We'll join up with my dad and the invasion force the day of the eclipse.
Let me see that.
This is a Water Tribe weapon. Turns to Aang, his expression serious. See if you can find anything else.
It's burned. Cut to shot of a tree trunk, scorch marks and sharp cuts running across its bark. Cut to shot of Sokka and the others. There was a battle! Water Tribe warriors ambushed a group of firebenders. He turns away from the tree and looking down the slope of the hill seeing a black spot on the ground. The firebenders fought back, but the warriors drove them down this hill.
Disappointed. I don't know. The trail ends here.
Happily. It's one of our boats!
No, but it's from his fleet. Strokes the boat off, while Aang appears behind them. Dad was here. Turns to Katara.
I'm coming with you.
Desperately. I'm strong, I'm brave, I can fight! Please, Dad!
I don't understand. His eyes glisten.
Alert. Who's there? Stands up, boomerang in hand.
Quizzically, raising an eyebrow. Bato? Spirited.
Where's Dad?
What smells so good, Bato?
Perfume? Pointing his thumbs at Appa. Maybe we can dump some on Appa, because he stinks so much. Waves his hand in front of his face. Am I right? Everyone is silent, a single person coughs.
Everything's here, even the pelts!
Dad could eat a whole barrel of these things!
Cutting Aang off. So, who was it that came up with the Great Blubber Fiasco?
Waving Aang off. It's a long one Aang, some other time.
Was it you or Dad that put an octopus on your head and convinced Gran-Gran you were a water spirit?
Slightly demanding. When?
It's been over two years since we've seen Dad. That would be so incredible! Katara!
It would be great, but we can't. We have to take Aang to the North Pole first.
To Bato. Is this the boat he took you ice dodging in?
How are we supposed to ice dodge without ice?
Studies the rocky shores. Aang, ease up on the jib. Katara, steady. Katara looks at the shore with concern. Aang, less sail. Katara, give him room. The ship moves to the side and sails between some rocks. Aang, helm to lee. Helm to lee!
Great job!
We can make it.
Aang, I'm gonna need air in that sail. Aang nods. Katara, I want you to bend as much water as you can between us and those rocks. Now!
Angrily. This is the map to our father! You had it the whole time? How could you? Aang shrugs his shoulders. Well, you can go to the North Pole on your own. I'm going to find Dad. Walks away.
Turns back. Katara, are you with me?
It's probably wounded.
We need to go back. I wanna see Dad, but, helping Aang is where we're needed the most.
Thanks, Bato.
We split up. He's long gone.
Pretty stupid. Grabs his sister. Run!
I'm ... starting to get some feeling back! Rubble from the roof falls on him. Ow.
That thing sees with its nose. Let's give him something to look at.
Yeah, we've lost too much time as it is.
Of course we do, Aang. But, you're our family, too. And right now, you need us more.
Long enough for moss to grow on the hull. He turns to Katara; unsure. About three months.
Cut to a shot from behind Aang. I wonder why they left this boat? There's nothing wrong with it.
He turns away. I don't want to talk about it.
Sokka enters the shot and proceeds to lay down in front of the campfire; interrupting Katara. Maybe we should all get some sleep.
This is crazy! How can we beat a guy who blows things up with his mind?
Cut to Sokka. This is boomerang!
As he lands slowly. Thanks, Aang, for catching me. You know, I'm sick and tired of being used as everyone's personal His voice changes to a nasal one as Aang grabs his nose. dummy ... Camera zooms out to show Aang airbending a lot of air into Sokka's mouth, causing Sokka to inflate. Sokka is unable to open his mouth, making him unable to talk properly as he rises into the sky above. Aang! What are you doing?
Coming out of the pond, catching a fish. Angrily. All right, enough! No more bending!
Amused. Rock beats airbender!
You're awfully cute, but unfortunately you're made of meat. Just a bit closer ... Jumps but falls into a crack that is in the ground. He looks at the cub. Gotcha! Sinks further in. You are one lucky little meat creature.
You probably think I deserve this, don't you? Look, I'm sorry I hunted you, but that's just the natural order of things. Big things eat smaller things, nothing personal. But this time it didn't work out that way. I admit it ... you're cute. Okay, you convinced me, if I get out of this alive, it's a karmically correct, vegetarian existence for me. No meat. Even though meat is so tasty. The cub brings an apple. Hey, looks like my karma is already paying off! That's okay, I got it. Tosses his boomerang at it in a desperate attempt. Now, come back boomerang.
Okay, karma person or thing, whoever's in charge of this stuff. If I can just get out of this situation alive, I will give up meat and sarcasm. Okay? Sokka's warrior's wolf tail gets yanked out of his hair by the cub. Ow! That's all I got. It's pretty much my whole identity. Sokka, the meat and sarcasm guy. But I'm willing to be Sokka, the veggies and straight talk fellow. Deal? Aang shows up. Aang! Thank goodness! Have you got any meat?
Aggh, stop, stop! You're going to pull my fingers off and I don't think the rest of me is coming!
Seriously Aang, I know you're new at it, but I could use a little earthbending here. How about it?
Well, if you can't earthbend me out of here, go get Toph.
You can't? Why not?
Uncomfortable? Sarcastically. Well, I wouldn't want you to feel uncomfortable ...
Awkward position, I think I know the feeling.
Hmmm ... how about that. Aang, this is my friend, Foo Foo Cuddlypoops. Foo Foo Cuddlypoops, Aang.
Really? He looks nothing like a saber-tooth moose-lion.
Aang, this is bad, you've got to get me out of here!
This is really bad! Please Aang, you have to earthbend me out, there's no other way!
Please, don't leave me again.
What are you doing here?
Sarcastically. Awww, this is a really wonderful, touching moment. So could you get me out of here so I can give you both a big, snuggly hug?
Yeah, no crushing, please.
The whole time, I was in that hole, not knowing if I was going to live or die. It makes a man to think about what's really important. I realizedâ
Pensively. It's pricey ... but I really do like it.
I do, don't I? Katara looks at him with a bored expression. But no, it's too expensive. I shouldn't.
Enthusiastically. You know what? I'm gonna get it. Smiles in a pleased way.
Laughs and wipes tears of laughter away. Oh, I got to remember that one!
Looking at his bag, holding it out. What was I thinking? Angrily to Aang. I don't need a new bag! Why did you let me buy this?
I guess that's why.
Happily. That's what I paid for.
Yelling. Go back to the Fire Nation!
Yeah! Wooo! Points at Fire Nation Man. The Boulder knows how to put the hurt in the dirt! Close-up of Sokka as he continues to cheer and make taunting faces. Yeah! Woohoo!
Camera moves back to include Sokka in the shot; deadpanned. I think she is ... Shouting, gesturing downward with both hands. going down!
Go Aang! Avenge The Boulder!
Boo! No Katara turns to her brother with a look of disapproval. talking!
Gets the belt and gold. Way to go, champ!
I've got to admit, now I'm really glad I bought this bag. It matches the belt, perfectly.
Smugly. Nicely done.
States coolly. Water Tribe.
Don't answer to Twinkle Toes, it's not manly!
Look, we all have to do our part to win this war, and yours is to teach Aang earthbending.
Whoever took Aang and Toph left this. Hands the note to Katara.
Serious. I can't believe it ... Grabs the note much to Katara's surprise and runs off a few feet. Cut to a further off shot; enthusiastically. I have The Boulder's autograph!
Here's your money. Sets the bag of gold on the ground. Now let them go.
I'm trying!
Well, we'd better get out of here, before your dad changes his mind again.
Sorry.
You know what I love about Appa the most? His sense of humor.
Laughs. Classic Appa.
Delirious. Take that, you rock! He flails his arms as if he is hitting something.
Ha, ha! You guys are killing me!
Weakly. Katara, please, water.
Weakly. Water ...
Delirious. Who's this "Aang" kid you keep talking about, Your Highness? Katara gets an annoyed look on her face.
With his mouth full; still spouting out nonsense. Aang, how was your trip? Did you make any new friends?
Mmmm! This is tasty! Mmm!
Hey, can I talk to you for a second? Stands up and walks out.
If someone was captured by the Fire Nation, where would they be taken?
When the invasion plan failed, some of our troops were taken. I just want to know where they might be.
What? Why not?
It's my dad. He was captured too. I need to know what I put him through.
Please.
What's that?
So, where is this place?
Nothing. Pauses for a moment. Boy, you're so paranoid.
Thanks, Zuko. Yawns. Just knowing makes me feel better.
To Appa. Shhh.
Falls off Appa, his bag's contents fall out. Fine, you caught me. I'm gonna rescue my dad. You happy now?
Picking up the fallen items. Look, I have to do this. The invasion plan was my idea, it was my decision to stay when things were going wrong. Zuko jumps off of Appa. It's my mistake, and it's my job to fix it. I have to regain my honor. You can't stop me, Zuko. Pushes Zuko aside and begins to climb up Appa on Appa's saddle.
No. I have to do this alone.
Pretty clouds.
What? Oh, I didn't say anything. You know, a friend of mine actually designed these war balloons.
Yep, a balloon ... but for war.
Yeah, it seems to run in the family.
I know, I know, you've changed.
I think your uncle would be proud of you. Leaving your home to come help us? That's hard.
Really? You didn't leave behind anyone you cared about?
Smiles and looks at Zuko with interest. That gloomy girl who sighs a lot?
My first girlfriend turned into the moon.
The air outside is just as hot as the air inside so we can't fly!
I don't know! Crash-landing?
We'll figure something out! I suspected it might be a one-way ticket.
Walks to the destroyed balloon. My dad might be here! I had to come and see!
Gathers parts from the balloon together. Hey, I never wanted you to come along in the first place! And for the record, I always think things through! But my plans haven't exactly worked, so this time, I'm playing it by ear. So there. After the hot water on the balloon burns his hand, Sokka kicks it into the water.
It doesn't work anyway, and we don't want anyone to find it.
We just need to lay low and find my dad as soon as possible.
We can't blow our cover.
Super cute.
Whispers to Zuko. Meet back here in an hour. Runs up to Chit Sang and the guard.
Playing along. Prisoners! Am I right?
It sure looks cold in there.
Lifts up his helmet's visor. Zuko?
What? Are you sure, did you double-check?
No. No! Bangs his fists against the wall in frustration.
So we came all this way for nothing? I failed ... again.
Maybe we haven't failed after all!
No, what you said made no sense at all. But look ... As he points, the camera shifts to an overhead view of the yard, before rapidly zooming in on a dejected-looking Suki. It's Suki!
Crosses arms. You mean you don't recognize me?
Frontal shot; smugly. Oh? Then maybe you'll recognize this.
They both stand up, not releasing each other. The other Kyoshi Warriors, are they here?
Places his right hand on her left cheek. Well, you won't be here for long. I'm busting you out.
Grabs Zuko and throws him down on the floor. You're under arrest! Whispering. Don't worry, I'll figure it out.
Oh, good, you guys have met.
So, listen, I think I have an escape plan. I checked out the coolers again, and the point of them is to keep firebenders contained, right?
So, they're completely insulated and sealed to keep the cold in. Well, to keep the cold in, it also has to keep the heat out, right?
It's a perfect boat for getting through the boiling water.
I'm telling you, it'll work. Flashes back to Sokka walking around the island; voice-over. I walked around the perimeter. There's a blind spot between two guard towers. It's the perfect launching point. Sokka puts a miniature boat in the water and watching it float away. I already tested it out. We'll roll the cooler into the water and just float with the current. It'll take us straight across. As long as we don't make a sound, no one will notice. Fade back to Sokka talking to Zuko and Suki. And bing-bang-boom, we're home free.
Covering up. What? We didn't ... w-we didn't say that.
Yeah, the only thing we're hatching is ... an egg?
Okay, you're in. Handing Zuko a wrench. Now first we need someone to unbolt the cooler, from the inside.
Approaching. Yelling. I need backup over here!
I can take you back to your cell if you've learned your lesson.
Lifts his visor; whispering. I got Suki and Chit Sang out of their cells a few minutes ago. They'll be waiting for us at the shore.
I know.
I don't know! Is it right for me to risk Suki's freedom, all of our freedom on the slim chance that my dad is gonna show up?
Fine. Everybody in the cooler. Let's go. They move the cooler into the water. Cut to Sokka lifting a rock hiding his Water Tribe outfit.
Turns to Zuko. If I had just cut my losses at the invasion, maybe we wouldn't be in this mess. Maybe sometimes it's just better to call it quits before you fail.
Standing. That supposed to make me feel better?
Seriously, not helping.
No. I'm staying. You guys go. To Suki. You've been here long enough.
We gave up our only chance of escaping. I hope we haven't just made a huge mistake.
The plan failed! They're caught!
The gondola's moving. Cut to a side-view of the gondola approaching the prison. Cut to a view of the prison yard as the gondola nears its stop. Cut to Sokka and Suki now in the yard. This is it. Cut to the gondola arriving. Cut to Sokka, Zuko and Suki in the yard. If my dad's not there, we've risked everything for nothing.
Come on, come on ...
My dad doesn't have a nose ring. Cut briefly to the gondola as several men step off. Where is he? Cut to the gondola briefly as we see one more prisoner exit. Hakoda does not appear. That's it? That can't be it.
Oh, no.
Cut to Sokka, Shocked. Dad ...
Dad ... Exiting a stairway and passing through a lineup of guards, surprising them a bit. Excuse me, coming through. The warden wants me over there. Points in the warden's direction. Sorry!
Approaches his father. Thank goodness you're okay.
Lifting up his helmet mask. Dad, it's me.
Rubs the back of his neck sheepishly. Yeah, I ran into that problem earlier.
To Hakoda. So where's Bato? Cut to inside the prison cell; Sokka turns away from the door. Where's everyone else from the invasion?
Smiles. You mean the Kyoshi Warriors?
Their leader Suki is here and she's gonna escape with us.
And you know Prince Zuko?
Well, he's here too.
Actually, he's on our side now. Cut to Hakoda, who gives his son a suspicious look. I know. I had the same reaction. After all he's done, it was hard to trust him. But he's really proven himself, and I never would've found you without his help. Hakoda nods his head at Sokka, indicating that he understands.
Downcast. We had one, but some of the other prisoners got involved and ruined it. Leans forward and rests his face in his arms. I dunno if there's another way off this island.
Then we'd better find two.
In a hushed voice. Zuko, are you there?
I just got done talking to my dad. We came up with an escape plan together.
Pointing to the cell and trying to act gruff. I was just telling this dirty lowlife what I think of him!
Puzzled. Why?
Could I just get ten more seconds to rough him up a bit? Punches his palm with his fist.
Off-camera from inside the cell. Take that ... and this! Punching noises come from the cell.
In a hushed voice while still punching the mattress. We have a new plan, but it's gonna need a big distraction. Cuts to shot of Zuko who peers from behind the blanket; off camera. Be in the yard in one hour.
Places his hand on her shoulder. I don't have much time. If I'm seen with you the guards might think something's up. Walks over to the door and peers outside. I just talked to my dad.
Yeah, and we're escaping today, on the gondola.
My dad and I came up with the plan together. We're gonna commandeer the gondola Puts both hands on her shoulders. and we're gonna take a hostage with us so they won't cut the lines.
My dad already thought of that. He said we'll need a distraction. That's why we're gonna start a prison riot.
Not if the warden is the captive. Nearby noise occurs. Moves to look outside. I have to go. Suki hugs him. I'll find you before we start the riot. Cut to outside the cell, where he slides out of the cell.
Why?
Maybe I could schedule another time with him? How's tomorrow? Walks off-screen.
Hey, I just got orders. Let the prisoners out into the yard.
Oh, okay, I'll just go tell the warden you said that. Walks off-screen; the guard raises his mask and looks at him speechless. I'm sure he'll be glad to hear about you undermining his authority. Guard grows more nervous. Walks back on-screen, lifting his helmet mask. What's your name again?
Hey, I'm confused too, but the warden's in a bad mood, and ... irrational, so if you ask me, it's best not to question it, and just do what he says. Places his arm around the guard's shoulder.
This is it! We have to start a riot.
This isn't working.
Gets an idea. Actually, we're trying to escape right now, but we need a riot. Points to him. You wouldn't happen to know how to start one, would you?
Zuko! Good, we're all here. Now all we need to do is grab the warden, and get to the gondolas!
I'm not sure.
I thought you told me it's okay not to think everything through!
Proudly. Tell me about it.
What are you doing?
Way to think ahead.
Who's that?
Zuko, what are you doing?
Yeah, and she's probably right behind us, so let's not stop!
I did. The best meat of all. The meat of friendship and fatherhood.
We kind of went to a Fire Nation prison.
It's not getting away from me this time. Close-up of Sokka as he grins confidently over his shoulder in the direction of Katara. Watch and learn, Katara. This is how you catch a fish.
Close-up of Sokka; whispering. Sshh! Katara, you're going to scare it away. A look of bliss adorns his face. He licks his lips and wiggles his fingers, not taking his eyes off the fish. Mmmm ... I can already smell it cookin'.
Why is it that every time you play with magic water, I get soaked?
Cutting her off. Yeah, yeah, "an ancient art unique to our culture", blah, blah, blah. Look, I'm just saying Grabbing his warrior's wolf knot with his left hand as he turns away from her, wringing the water out of it. Meanwhile, Katara has crossed her arms. that if I had weird powers, I'd keep my weirdness to myself.
You don't like my steering? Well, maybe you should've He waves his hands, mockingly imitating waterbending. waterbended us out of the ice.
Annoyed. I knew I should've left you home! Cut to a close-up of the siblings; Katara is staring down at her brother in anger while he rants calmly. Leave it to a girl to screw things up!
Pointing to the iceberg behind her, his voice subdued by fright. Uh ... Katara ...
In a screeching voice, his eyes open wide in fear. Katara, settle down!
Okay, you've gone from "weird" to "freakish", He releases her. Katara.
Sarcastically, glancing at her and smirking. Yep. Nudging her with his elbow. Congratulations.
Katara, get back here! He grabs his spear from the ice and runs after Katara, who is already at the ice's edge. We don't know what that thing is!
Brandishing his spear in defense once again. Stop!
Aggressively. You tell us! Points at the top of the crater. How did you get in the ice? And why aren't you frozen? He pokes the boy in his side with his spear.
What is that thing?
Sarcastically. Right, and this is Katara, my flying sister. Katara shoots him an odd look.
Pointing his spear accusingly again at Aang who is surprised to see the thing. Don't answer that! Did you see that crazy bolt of light?! He was probably trying to signal the Fire Navy!
Total disbelief. You just sneezed ... Points to the sky. and flew ten feet in the air!
Giant light beams, flying bison, airbenders ... Walks away. I think I got midnight sun madness. I'm going home to where stuff makes sense. He realizes, however, that he is stranded in the middle of the ocean with no way home.
Oh no! I'm not getting on that fluffy snot monster!
Sarcastically. Wow, that was truly amazing ...
Annoyed. What is this, a weapon? You can't stab anything with this!
Mockingly states his disbelief. Ya know, last time I checked, humans can't fly!
Shocked. My watchtower!
Annoyed. Great. You're an airbender, Katara's a waterbender. Together you can just waste time all day long. He wedges himself free from underneath the weight of the snow and stalks off.
With a stern expression. Now men, it's important that you show no fear when you face a firebender. He brings out his club and holds it proudly. In the Water Tribe, we fight to the last man standing! For without courage, how can we call ourselves men? He clutches his fist to emphasize the word "men" as he stares down the people in front of him.
Angrily. Listen! Until your fathers return from the War, they're counting on you to be the men of this tribe, and that means no potty breaks! He makes some wide arm gestures to emphasize his words again.
Sighs. Okay, who else has to go?
Annoyed. Uh! Angrily points at Aang. Katara, get him out of here! This lesson is for warriors only!
Yelling angrily. Stop! Stop it right now! The laughter of the children is stifled immediately and Appa turns his head to look at Sokka, who accusingly directs his anger to Aang. What's wrong with you?! We don't have time for fun and games with the War going on!
Raises one eyebrow in disbelief. You're kidding, right?
He's kidding, right?
With his hair covering his eyes. You guys are going to be done soon, right? We have a lot of ground to cover if we're going to make it to Omashu today.
I could be ready in two minutes. Seriously, Pulls back the hair covering his eyes. whenever.
Walks over and says accusingly. Who are you?
Look, I hate to be the wet blanket here, but since Katara is busy, I guess it's up to me.
We need to get to Omashu. No sidetracks, no worms and definitely no rainbows.
Impatiently. O. Ma. Shu!
Unamused while folding his arms. I think we'll just stick with flying. We've dealt with the Fire Nation before. We'll be fine.
Pointing forward. Secret love cave, let's go.
How far are we from the tunnel?
Halts in his tracks; in shock. Labyrinth?
In a somewhat whining voice. Curse!
Cuts to shot of inscription on the side of the cave entrance. What exactly is this curse?
That's it! There's no way we're going through some cursed hole!
Grimly. It's Fire Nation. They're tracking us.
Gesturing to the cave; somewhat commanding. Everyone into the hole!
We will be fine. All we need is a plan. Chong, how long do those torches last?
Grabbing torches and stomping out the fire. It doesn't work like that if they're all lit at the same time!
I'm going to make a map to keep track of exactly where we've been. Then we should be able to solve it like a maze and get through.
This doesn't make sense. We already came through this way.
Cuts to an overhead shot of the group standing in the dark cave before switching to Sokka who looks up from the map. There's something strange here. There's only one explanation. Cuts to shot of the rest of the group before switching to Sokka who turns to face the camera. The tunnels are changing.
Sarcastically. Right, if only we listened to you.
Horrified. Nooooo!
Defensively. At least I'm thinking of ideas and trying to get us out of here, Moku.
Angrily; spreads arms out dramatically. Yes! We're all thinking of ideas!
No, they were trying to get away from something!
Singing nervously. Badgermoles coming toward me. Come on guys, help me out!
How did you guys get out?
Really? We let huge, ferocious beasts lead our way.
Irritated yet blushing. Just play your songs.
From afar. The journey was long and annoying, but now you get to see what it's really about: the destination. Close-up of him. I present to you the Earth Kingdom city of O- Pauses abruptly. Oh no ...
That's not grass. Somewhat displeased.Â  Appa's shedding.
Bending over, his back turned to her. It's not that bad, Katara. He turns to reveal a wig made of fur, done up in a towering beehive. It makes a great wig!
Sarcastically. Your powers of perception are frightening.
Amused. Hey, I'm just enjoying the show.
Annoyed; pushes Katara off to the side. Hey, how's a guy supposed to sleep with all this yelling To Toph. and earthquaking?
Well, how far away is it? Lies down and pulls covers of his sleeping bag over his head; says in a muffled voice. Maybe we can close our eyes just for a few minutes.
Lands onto the ground. Okay, forget about setting up camp. Crawls along the ground in sleeping bag. I'm finding the softest pile of dirt and going to sleep.
Puts his head down. Oh, just some angry freak with a ponytail who's tracked us all over the world.
Points to his top-knot. This is a warrior's wolf tail.
Raises head, unamused. Anyway, whoever's chasing us couldn't have followed us here, so, now would everyone just shhh?
Hold up finger to silence the lemur. No Momo, shhh. Relaxes. Sleepy time.
Buries face in hands. Oh, don't tell me ...
Hopelessly. Always the optimist ...
Actually Toph, there's four of us.
Turning to her, his face distorted with rage. I can still fight!
Face turns red. Errrgh!
Well, we wanted to find out who they were and we found out. Puts boomerang away; Aang and Katara are seen fleeing. Now let's get out of here.
Complaining. Oh no, the sun is rising. We've been up all night with no sleep!
Nervously. Are you sure? I've never not slept before! Holds hands up to his head. What if I fall asleep now and something happens? Freaks out; eyes bulge out. And something always happens!
Relieved. Yes ... sleep.
Trudging across the ground, carrying his sleeping bag. Okay, we've put in a lot of distance between us and them. The plan right now is to follow Appa's lead and get some sleep.
Moves in front of Toph, his arms outstretched to halt her. Wait!
From afar, drinking from a cup. Yeah, you two were pretty much jerks.
No problem.
Okay, but what are we going to do about the tank full of dangerous ladies chasing us?
Surveying the woods. Toph couldn't have made it too far. Momo begins to chitter and rears up defensively. What is it, Momo? Ooooh, no! Katara!
Urgently. Appa, come on, we need to go faster!
Frantically. Not good, not good! Appa grunts;. Cuts to ground level view of Mai and Ty Lee chasing after them. Cuts to shot of Appa heading toward the river. We just need to make it across that river!
Voice-over. We made it! We're safe.
Well off-balance. Good try, but no.
How are you doing?
Still lying on the ground. Thanks Appa, I don't know what we'd do without you.
Slightly skeptically. Hey, don't jinx it! We can still be attacked by some giant exploding Fire Nation spoon. Or find out the city's been submerged in an ocean full of killer shrimp!
I'm just sayin', weird stuff happens to us.
Somewhat optimistically. He's a giant bison! Where could someone possibly hide him?
Realizing the city's gigantic size. Oh.
Excitedly. What's the problem? It's amazing!
Yes. We have information about the Fire Nation army that we need to deliver to the Earth King, immediately.
Slightly annoyed. Ugh! Walks up to Joo Dee. Maybe you missed what I said. We need to talk to the king about the War, it's important.
Yeah, we met a professor from the Ba Sing Se University. He took us to an ancient underground library where we discovered information about the war that is Cut to inside carriage. Leaning toward Joo Dee, losing his patience. absolutely crucial for the Earth King to hear!
Is that woman deaf? She only seems to hear every other word I say.
And who're the mean-looking guys in robes?
Close-up view of Team Avatar. Surprised. A month?
Cut to view of entire room from the back. I think we would enjoy it more if we weren't staying for so long. Can't we see the Earth King any sooner?
Slightly frustrated. Where's the black market? Who runs it? Pointing at him accusingly. Come on, you know!
Annoyed. Right. And which of your professors could we ask about the war with the Fire Nation?
He gestures to the rest of Team Avatar to follow him. Hey, come with me.
So, Pong, what's goin' on with this city? Why is everyone here so scared here to talk about the war?
Close-up view. He is lying upside down. Certainly you mean his pet skunk bear.
Side-view of room. Excitedly. Aha, but you learned it! You could teach us!
Stands up also wearing a curtain like a robe. Mimicking a typical high class person. Avatar Aang, how do you do? Go on.
But I feel so fancy! Toph's snot falls on Sokka's forehead.
Wriggling his hands. Fire!
Look, I came up with a back-up plan. He picks Momo up. We dress Momo like a ghost, okay? Moves Momo in a circle. He flies by the guards, creating a distraction. Then, we blast a hole in the wall-
Okay ... Rolls his eyes. But remember that Momo ghost plan. I think it's a winner. Smiling, he and Aang sink behind the pedestal.
Forget about them! Just keep an eye out for the king. He grows slightly annoyed as Momo's tail, which has been sticking out of Aang's hat, begins to wag in his face.
You know, royal, flowing robe, fancy jewelry. He grabs Momo's tail, still wagging in his face, and vigorously stuffs it back into Aang's hat.
Opening his eyes, realizing who they are. Sarcastically. Thanks for letting us in!
Slightly confused, not seeing anyone following them. What guy?
Not until we see the king.
Whispers. You keep their attention while I look for the king.
Aang! The Earth King!
Hey, let me go!
Why won't you let us talk to the king? We have information that could defeat the Fire Nation!
Side-view of room. But we found out about a solar eclipse that will leave the Fire Nation defenseless. You could lead an invasion ...
So, what kind of trouble is Katara in?
It would be nice if your Avatar powers could be just a little more specific from time to time. He looks down and notices a mound of earth passing nearby, heading to the wall. What is that?
Need a ride?
Aang, are you okay?
See, Aang? She's with Suki. They're probably back at our apartment right now talking about make-up or something.
Oh, no!
Approaching Aang and pointing at him. Whoa there! You lost me at "Zuko".
Pushing Iroh away. "Good inside him" isn't enough! Why don't you come back when it's outside him too, okay?
My sister! Where are they keeping Katara?
We should split up. Aang, you go with Iroh to look for Katara and the angry jerk, Remembers Iroh is there and places his left hand on Iroh's right shoulder. no offense.
And I'll go with Toph to warn the Earth King of Azula's coup.
There's General How!
The coup is happening right now! We've gotta warn the Earth King!
Thank goodness we're in time!
He begins to sweat and places his hand behind his head in discomfort. Nervously. Uh, I'm kinda involved with Suki.
Nope, all clear.
Let's go. Sokka grabs the Earth King's hand and follows Toph.
Stands up. No. Cut to close-up of the fog, five Water Tribe ships suddenly appearing from amid the mist. That is the invasion!
Spirited. Where you able to locate everyone I told you to find?
Was that a new invention?
The others seems disgusted. You're making peanut sauce bombs?
Where you able to complete work on the plans I send you?
Good morning everyone. Ahh! Trips on stage. Umm ... so, as you know, today, we're invading the Fire Nation! I mean I know you know that because otherwise why else would you be here? Laughs nervously. Uh anyway, Dropping scrolls. Unraveling one on a board. the Fire Lord's palace is here Points at map, realizing it isn't the map, flips the chart several times until it is the map.. Uh nope, uh wait, uh wait, uh wait, it's here, Brief shot of Due scratching his head. and uh, there's an eclipse today and Aang's gonna fight the Fire Lord and the firebenders won't have any fire to use so that's good for us! Brief shot of Teo and the mechanist looking on. And ... um ... I'm sorry let me start at the beginning Stands up straight, and begins talking very fast.. Katara and I discovered Aang frozen in an iceberg, now I didn't like Aang at first but grew to love him over time, then we went to the Southern Air Temple where Aang used to live and then we met Suki, Water Tribe warrior yawns. who's a Kyoshi warrior. She dressed me like a woman and then she kissed me, and then Aang's friend was a crazy old king and ...
... And then Katara got Haru arrested and then now he's grown a mustache which if you look at him in the front row you can see it ...
I messed up, Aang.
The invasion plan was my moment of truth and I completely flubbed it. I just fell apart.
My dad is! He explained the plan perfectly and inspired everyone, like a real leader should.
You seem so confident about everything, how do you know we're gonna win?
Well, I just came up with the idea. The mechanist did all the work.
Are you ready for the Fire Nation to know the Avatar is alive?
Katara, what are you doing? It's time to submerge.
Dad, look out!
I've got an idea.
Dad! The two run to his side.
Can't you heal him any faster?
Looks around before looking confidant. I'll do it.
No. Stands confidently. I'll lead the invasion force.
Maybe I am a little crazy, but the eclipse is about to start and we need to be up that volcano by the time it does.
Nods, puts his helmet on and boards Appa. Yip yip.
Listen up, everyone. I want the tanks in wedge formation. Warriors and benders in the middle. We're taking that tower, and heading for the royal palace. All the tanks come together in wedge formation behind Appa, soldiers protected in the middle. Cut to Sokka, on Appa, who draws his sword and thrusts it forward. Charge!
Brightening. Dad! Rising and approaching the two. You're on your feet again.
Everything's going smoothly and the eclipse hasn't even kicked in yet.
Shocked. What? Cuts to shot of Aang riding in on his glider, dodging several fireballs. He lands in front of the group. Please tell me you're here because the Fire Lord turned out to be a big wimp and you didn't even need the eclipse to take him down.
With epiphany; the camera shifts from a side-view of his face to a frontal view. They knew.
Thoughtfully. No. My instincts tell me he wouldn't go too far. He would have a secret bunker; somewhere he could go and be safe during the siege but still be close enough to lead his nation.
Pulling out mechanism. The mechanist gave me this timing device. It looks like we've got about ten minutes until the full eclipse. Ten minutes to find the Fire Lord.
To Aang. What do you think? You're the one that has to face the Fire Lord. Whatever you decide, I'm with you.
Anything else? Is there a structure somewhere?
Raises arms up in the background. Sounds like a secret bunker to me.
Following her. What would we do without you?
Observing the magma channels; blushing. Yeah, pretty much.
We'll have to be fast, but careful.
I was wrong. We need to be fast, careful and lucky.
There's no floor. It's just a river of lava.
Impressed. That's some door!
Entering the bunker while making some hand movements. I am so glad we added you to the group!
Only thirty seconds until the total eclipse.
Stop wasting our time and give us the information. Points sword at her. You're powerless right now, so you're in no position to refuse.
Stops running. Wait! Aang! Toph! Stop attacking! Don't you see what she's doing? She's just playing with us. She's not even trying to win this fight!
She's just baiting you again.
We don't have a choice. We just have to get out of here and find the Fire Lord on our own somehow.
Waves hand up in gesture. Ignore!
Where. Is. Suki?!
Where's Suki? Answer me!
Ignores him. Where are you keeping her?
Ashamed. I fell for it! I used up all our time.
Sorrowfully. And now it's too late.
Matter-of-factly. No. I don't think that's a good idea.
Placing a hand on Aang's shoulder. You'll have another chance. I know you will.
Getting off Appa. It was all a trap! Azula knew we were coming and she's plotted out every move! Toph gets off, too. We've just got to get to the beach as fast as we can. Hakoda approaches. If we can make it to the submarines, maybe we can get away safely.
Everyone, let's get back to the subs! Begins running.
Try and find cover! I think we're about to see some bombs!
Hopelessly. How are we all going to escape?
Looks determined. Then our only choice is to stand and fight. We have the Avatar, we could still win.
Turning, alarmed. They're at the beach already!
Bye, Dad. We won't be apart for too long this time. I promise.
Who's going to save our lives now? We'll never make it out of here.
You think if we dig out the giant owl, he'll give us a ride?
Annoyed. Can't you watch where you're ... His eyes widen in comprehension as he sees who bumped into him.
Right. Sorry.
If I sweat anymore, I don't think sticking together will be a problem.
As he points to his mouth. We're drinking your bending water. He tries to define the taste of the water, smacking his lips. Disgustedly he exclaims. You used this on the swamp guy! Urch!
Not anymore! Look!
There's water trapped inside these!
While cactus juice drips off his chin. Suit yourself. It's very thirst quenching though.
In a strange echoing voice. Drink cactus juice. It'll quench ya! Nothing's quenchier. He crawls over the ground as a caterpillar before jumping back to the front, pushing his face toward the camera with a big smile. It's the quenchiest!
Who lit Toph on fire?
In awe. How did we get out here in the middle of the ocean?
It's a giant mushroom! Very excited. Maybe it's friendly!
Friendly mushroom! Mushy giant friend!
Pointing up at the sky. Why don't we ask the circle birds?
Theatrically panics, grabbing his head in despair. Momo, no! You've killed us all!
Relieved. Oh, right. Bending.
Offended. What?! I didn't steal anything! Who told you that? Pointing an accusing finger at Momo. It was you! You ratted me out!
Appaâ? But why would Princess Yue need himâ? She's the moon! Grabs Momo's tail, using it to rub his cheek. She flies by herself!
Dreamily. Take it easy little lady. I'm sure the sand folks who built this baby know how to get around here.
Breathes deeply. I think my head is starting to clear out the cactus juice. And look!
Tastes like rotten penguin meat! Awww, I feel woozy.
I have a natural curiosity.
Surprised. What are you doing? That rock almost crushed me!
I got this one.
I guess my head's not as clear as I thought.
Yeah! You got it! She got it, rightâ?
Just get out of here! Run!
Flips a small pouch to find it empty aside from a few crumbs. See if you can find a menu, I'm starving! Wipes his mouth.
Looking at another poster on the other side of the kiosk; seriously. You might wanna rethink that. Look at this.
A wanted poster! This is bad. Aang removes the poster from the wall and starts reading it.
Moves in front of Katara; in an opposing tone. What? You wanna walk into a Fire Nation town where they're all fired-up with their ... you know, fire? Aang becomes serious again.
Not convinced; sarcastically. Yeah! Because we always leave before we get into trouble.
Sarcastically at Aang's goofy disguise. It's like you're a whole different person ... Katara giggles.
Where are we gonna get masks like that?
That was surprisingly easy.
Finally! To the shop keeper. What do you have?
I'll take'em!
Aaahhh! Hot! Hot!
Sarcastically. Knowing the Fire Nation, it's probably an execution.
In a stern tone while pulling his arm down. What do you think you're doing?
No, we don't want to make a scene!
I think it's time to go.
I hope he can really hear that bison whistle!
Impressed. You really know your explosives ...
You're a Fire Nation Soldier!
Not amused. He was very highly ranked, we get it.
Snaps at Aang. We're not gonna go find some crazy firebender!
Look, thanks for the help, but we're leaving for the North Pole in the morning.
Very annoyed. That's what you said about going to the festival! Why doesn't anyone ever listen to me?
Hold on, you know these guys?
Finally! Let's hit the road. He stretches back out again.
Annoyed. Hey!
Concerned. Katara, what's wrong? Angrily. What did you do?!
I told you we shouldn't mess around with this! Look what you did! You burned my sister! Katara runs away. You burned my sister! As Jeong Jeong walks in. This is all your fault!
Katara! Are you all right?
Aang, come on! Let's go!
He disappeared. They all did.
When did you learn that?
Sarcastically. Oh ... Well then thanks for all the first aid over the years. Like when I fell into the greaseberry bramble. Angrily. Or that time I had two fishhooks in my thumb!
Still being sarcastic. Oh, and the time that mink snake bit me! Thanks for healing that up. That was great. Really helpful.
Now what's so big that Appa has to wait?
That's a good group name. Very catchy.
Slaps him across the face. Get a hold of yourself, man!
Why are you all looking at me?
Complaining. So I'm the only one who can ever come up with a plan? That's a lot of pressure.
That part I don't mind.
Excitedly. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh! Ooh!
What you just said! That's how we're going to take down the drill! The same way Ty Lee took down all those big earthbenders!
It's so dark down here, I can't see a thing!
Sheepishly. Sorry.
There!
Toph, come on!
Okay, good luck! He and Aang disappear into the drill.
I need a plan of this machine. Some schematics that show what the inside looks like. Then we can find its weak points.
That's the point. I figure a machine this big needs engineers to run it. And when something breaks ...
This'll work. Thanks!
It looks like the drill is made up of two main structures. There's the inner mechanism where we are now and the outer shell. The inner part and the outer part are connected by these braces. If we cut through them, the entire thing will collapse.
Wow, it looks a lot thicker in person than it does in the plans. We're going to have to work pretty hard to cut through that.
Turns and gestures to self. Look, I'm the plan guy. You two Makes rapid chop-chop gestures. are the cut stuff up with waterbending guys. Strikes a heroic pose. Together, we're Team Avatar!
Pumping arms in the air. C'mon team. Don't quit now. Katara grinds her teeth as she seethes with rage. We're ...
I mean, Recovers and points reassuringly. you're almost there.
Do you hear that? We took it down! We better get out of here fast!
Pushing against brace. C'mon brace ... budge! Makes several more attempts to move it.
We're putting everything we've got into busting these braces, but it's taking too long!
Rising. And boom! It all comes crashing down!
The whole world minus the Fire Nation that is.
Good work, Team Avatar! Now Aang just needs to ... Glances up in horror. duck!
Smiles and waves. Hey.
Having successfully opened hatch which leads to a canal channeling slurry. It's rock and water mixed together. It means our way out!
Katara, keep that up. The pressure will build up in the drill. Then when Aang delivers the final blow, it'll be ready to pop!
Good technique, little sister! Keep it up! Don't forget to breathe!
Screaming. Just bend the slurry, woman!
Woohoo!
I just want to say, good effort out there today, Team Avatar!
How about ... Pulls out boomerang. the Boomeraang Squad! See it's good because it's got "Aang" in it. Boomeraang.
The Aang Gang?
The Fearsome Foursome?
Why? We're fearsome!
Look, we escaped from the Dai Li. We got Appa back. I'm telling you, we should go to the Earth King now and tell him our plan. We're on a roll.
We can build on it. If we want to invade the Fire Nation when the eclipse happens, we'll need the Earth King's support.
I know, but I've got a good feeling about this. This time will be different.
See? Aang's with me. Puts his arm around Aang and smiles. It's the whole reason we came here in the first place. We have to try.
That's probably the Dai Li searching for us. To Katara. So?
There it is! That whole thing is the palace! The Earth King's chamber should be in the center!
Why would you assume that? If you ask me, I think we're just gonna sail right in and- A giant rock almost hits them. Aahh!
Surface-to-air rocks! Sees more being launched. More incoming!
Seriously, we're actually on your guys' side! Pauses for a moment. Sorry.
In there! They enter the palace.
Toph, which way to the Earth King?
Shuts the door. Sorry. Wrong door.
Now that's an impressive door. It's gotta go somewhere. Drops down from the rubble and attempts to kick the door open. Yaaah! The door does not move even slightly. Sokka starts trying to push it open, but to no avail. Toph and Aang jump in from behind and bust the door down, knocking Sokka forward in the process. He starts rubbing the back of his head. A little warning next time?
No, we're on your side. We're here to help.
But we dropped our weapons. We're your allies.
Uh, no. Him. Nudges his head at Aang.
Wait! Turns to face the king with a big smile. I can prove he's lying. Long Feng said he's never seen a sky bison. Ask him to lift his robe.
Never met a sky bison, huh?
Of course there is!
Underneath Lake Laogai, Your Kingliness. To the Dai Li's secret headquarters. You're about to see where all the brainwashing and conspiring took place.
Oh don't tell me-Â ! Gives a thumbs up and a fake smile. That's okay. Still got my positive attitude.
Hey, if anything, this proves the conspiracy exists even more. Smiles and nods.
Runs up to them. If you come with us, this time you can ride on Appa. The Earth King stops as Appa lows in the background. A pleased smile grows on his face.
It's a drill. A giant drill Cut to the drill. made by the Fire Nation to break through your walls. Cut to a close-up of the king who looks horrified.
Happily. Looks like Long Feng is long gone! Ha! Ah, yeah, I've been waiting to use that one. Aang smiles at him andÂ Katara gives him an unimpressed look.
That's why we came to Ba Sing Se, Your Highness: because we think you can help us end the war.
But there is hope. Before the comet comes, we have a window of opportunity: A solar eclipse is coming. The sun will be completely blocked out by the moon, and the firebenders will be helpless.
That's the day we need to invade the Fire Nation. Cut to a close-up of the king. Cut back to Sokka. The Day of Black Sun.
You're already vulnerable. The Fire Nation won't stop until Ba Sing Se falls. You can either sit back and wait for that to happen, or take the offensive and give yourself a fighting chance.
He and Katara become downcast. Oh.
Shocked. Appears on Katara's side. What? That could be Dad!
What's a guru? Some kind of poisonous blow fish?
This is all such big news! Where do we even start?
Someone has to stay here with the Earth King and help him plan for the invasion. Stands up. I guess that's me.
Overjoyed with tears welling in his eyes. Stands up and dances happily. You are the nicest ... sister ... ever! Throws his arms around Katara and kisses her on the cheek.
Throws Aang in a headlock. All right. Who's ready to get going on our little men-only man trip? Noogies Aang. Katara looks at him, annoyed.
Shocked. That's Suki! Falls off Appa.
Gets up. Oh yeah. The Kyoshi Warriors are a skilled group of fighters. Trustworthy too. They're good friends of ours.
Everyone goes to hug him. Aahh! Great. That's enough. Smiles. Okay, we love each other. Pats Aang and Katara on the head. Seriously.
You see, Aang? A little positive thinking works wonders. We got the king on our side, we got Long Feng arrested, and when we get back, Suki's waiting for me.
Everything is gonna work out perfectly. From now on and forever. Aang turns around and smiles at him.
You guys are not gonna believe this! There's a play about us.
Listen to this ... Turns the poster toward him. "The Boy in the Iceberg is a new production from acclaimed playwright Pu-on Tim, Cut to a close shot of the poster as the camera pans up. who scoured the globe gathering information on the Avatar, from the icy South Pole to the heart of Ba Sing Se. Shot changes to show Team Avatar. His sources include singing nomads, pirates, prisoners of war, and a surprisingly knowledgeable merchant of cabbage."
Persuasively. Come on, a day at the theater? This is the kind of wacky time-wasting nonsense I've been missing! He holds up the poster anxiously and smiles sheepishly; Katara looks away, appears nonplussed.
Leans forward in his seat; clearly annoyed. This is pathetic! My jokes are way funnier than this! Extends his arm in a dramatic gesture.
Shhh! Tearing up. I'm trying to watch! Suki looks away, and folds her arms.
Walks down the stairs holding a bag of flaming fire flakes and sits next to Suki. Apparently, the playwright thinks I'm an idiot who tells bad jokes about meat all the time!
Eats a fire flake. I know!
You know, it was really unclear.
Whispering. Oh, you're getting up? As Aang leaves. Can you get me some fire flakes? Puts his arm around Suki, but whispers to Aang again. Ooh, and fire gummies! Puts his arm back around Suki, who looks slightly annoyed.
You're one to talk, Suki. Didn't Azula take you captive? That's right, she did!
I'm just saying ...
He left to get me fire gummies, like, ten minutes ago. And I'm still waiting!
Suki, what are the chances you can get me backstage? I got some jokes I want to give to the actor me.
Actually, I think I can help you. I'm a big Sokka fan, but I don't think you're representing him quite as well as you could be.
Runs in front of him. Just hear me out. Pulls out some cards. Here's something I think the real Sokka would say. Clears throat. What does the cabbage merchant use to fix his cabbages? A cabbage patch!
Puts his arm around Actor Sokka's shoulder. Also, don't be afraid to make up some phrases, especially before an attack. Something like ... "Flying kick-a-pow!". The two begin to walk away.
I'm just a guy who likes comedy.
Here's what you missed ... we went to the Fire Nation, and you got better, and Katara was the Painted Lady, and I got a sword, and I think Combustion Man died. Oh, look, the Invasion's about to start! Shhh!
Laughs hysterically at Suki and Aang. Lifts up Aang's hat. I told him to say that!
Stands up and stretches. I guess that's it. The play's caught up to the present now.
Sits back down. But it is over, unless ... Dramatically. this is the future.
Walking with Suki. But the effects were decent!
Hey, jerks! Mind if I watch you two jerks do your jerkbending?
Okay, take it easy. He drops his half-eaten apple. I was just kiddin' around. He gets up and turns around, laughing as he adjusts his shirt. Jerkbending, still got it. Zuko drops his head, dejected, and moans.
Leans toward Zuko and points a finger above. Sooo, all we need to do is make Zuko angry. Easy enough.
Excited. How's he supposed to do thatâ? By jumping into a volcanoâ?
Seriously.â So, is it jumping into a volcano?
So, what? Aang and Zuko look back at him and the shot cuts to Sokka seated. Maybe you'll pick up some super old Sun Warrior energy just by standing Moves his hand in a strange motion. where they stood a thousand years ago?
Yeah, that's a great dance you two learned there.
Cut to Sokka, as he moves his fingers in a dancing manner. We'll just tap-dance our way to victory over the Fire Lord.
He is taunting us! Camera zooms out to the lake and the group's camp site. You are so going to be dinner!
Observes the fishing pole. Hey, where's the fishing line?
Walks over and examines the necklace. Aw, it's all tangled!
Sarcastically. Great, Aang. Maybe instead of saving the world, you can go into the jewelry-making business.
Stop taunting me!
Emerges from the water, holding the se tu. Smoochie, smoochie, someone's in love! Makes kissing noises before the se tu breaks free from his grasp, slapping Sokka in the face with its tail and disappearing under the water.
No, play dead! He'll lose interest!
No, punch him in the bill! Swings a fist upward.
Joyfully picks up the egg. Mmm, lunch! He sniffs it. Lucky for you, we came along.
But the fortuneteller was wrong! You didn't have a safe journey; you were almost killed!
Oh, come on. Fortune telling is nonsense!
Holding egg above his head to shield himself from the rain. No, it doesn't! You can't really tell the future!
Crossly. Of course she predicted it was going to rain. The sky's been gray all day!
Look, I'm going to predict the future now. Stops walking and hops from foot to foot in an exaggerated way. It's going to keep drizzling. The rain continues to fall. See?
Disgusted. Agh!
Brightening. I'll try a curd puff.
Waves hand in dismissal and jokes. Don't be modest! Spreads arms outward in emphasis. They're huge!
I can't believe we're here in the house of nonsense.
Nonchalantly. It would be nice to have some bean curd puffs.
Delighted; with his mouth full. Mm, not bad, not bad! Holding out bowl to Aang. Mhm?
Causally, holding up puff. Boring stuff I'm sure. Love, who she's going to marry, how many babies she's going to have.
Looks like someone had a pretty good bathroom break.
Disgusted, looking away and holding up a hand to signal Aang to stop. I don't even want to know!
Rising. Okay, let's get this over with.
Holding up his hands in protest. But you didn't read my palms or anything!
Well, now you got to see for yourselves how fortune telling is just a big, stupid hoax.
Voice rising in anger. That woman is crazy! My life will calm and happy and joyful!
That doesn't prove anything!
Disgusted. Do you even hear yourself?
I can't believe you would trust your lives to that crazy, old woman's superstition!
I can't believe all these saps! Cuts to side-view of Sokka walking forward, Aang following close behind. Someone really needs to scream some sense into them.
Not for long. I'm going to prove Aunt Wu's predictions are nonsense. Pulls over a man standing nearby. Hey you, I bet Aunt Wu told you to wear those red shoes, didn't she? Cuts to shot of the man's red shoes.
Uh huh ... And how many times have you worn those shoes since you got that fortune?
Background becomes a spiral of swirling orange and yellow flames; angry. Then of course it's gonna come true!
Crazed. I don't care what Aunt Wu told you! You have to take a bath sometime!
Pleased. Some stuff? Places an arm around Aang's shoulders. You've come to the right place. What can I do you for?
Thinking of Meng rather than Katara. I think I know who you mean.
Of course I am. And to tell you the truth, I've been picking up a subtle vibe that she likes you, too.
Oh yeah, she's crazy about you. All you have to do now is not mess it up.
The number once mistake nice guys like you make: being too nice.
Yep. If you want to keep her interested, you have to act aloof, like you don't really care one way or the other.
Impressed. Wow, that kid is good.
Off-camera. I can't believe you're dragging me all the way up here for a stupid flower.
Flowers are fine once you're married, but at this early stage, it's critical that you maintain maximum aloofness.
Irritated. What? Don't tell me you believe in that stuff, too.
Those people all think they're safe! We've got to warn them!
Well, we have other things to worry about. Aunt Wu was wrong about the volcano.
Urgently. Everyone, that volcano is gonna blow any second! Aunt Wu was wrong!
Look! Points to the volcano. Can your fortune telling explain that?
Turns to him; yells angrily. Yes! Yes, it can!
I know that's the problem.
Aunt Wu, look! Something is happening in the clouds.
Making motions with his arm. Lava is gonna flow downhill to this spot. If we can dig a deep enough trench we can channel all the lava away from the village to the river.
Everybody else grab a shovel As another explosion resonates over the village, everyone stumbles before regaining balance. Come on! We've gotta hurry!
Resuming work. Dig faster! Dig faster!
Man, sometimes I forget what a powerful bender that kid is. Katara's expression changes at this, remembering Aunt Wu's words about her future marriage.
Casually. Nothing, just that Aang is one powerful bender.
No offense, but I hope this taught everyone a lesson about not relying too much on fortune telling.
Gets near the Calm man's face, through gritted teeth. I hate you.
Right, got it ... Tosses the wrapped up tarp inside the tent.
Ordinarily, you'd be right, but seeing how it's the dry season, you're not. Besides that tarp makes a pretty warm blanket.
Spreading his arms wide in exasperation. What if it doesn't? Then I would have put up the tarp for nothing.
Katara, why don't you worry about gathering firewood, because that kindling is looking pretty sorry.
Angrily. Fine by me, if you're not gonna do your job- He tears the tent down and the two stare at each other angrily as Aang approaches.
Why don't you ask Miss Know-It-All, Queen of the Twigs.
At the same time. Whatever.
Okay, I've seen enough.
Then I'm sure we'll be able to see it very clearly from the air while we fly away.
Calm down, we know you're next.
Aang, this feuding tribe stuff is serious business. Are you sure it's a good idea getting involved in this?
Dismayed. His job's gonna make us cross this whole canyon on foot isn't it? Cut to an overhead wide shot of the two tribes and the others.
We gotta help him! He throws his boomerang at the crawler, which drops the canyon guide and comes after Sokka instead. Okay, now we gotta help me! Katara comes to his aid and does a water whip on the crawler, but she is quickly thrown aside. Aang jumps down and sends a multiple blasts of air at the crawler and drives it away.
I thought the whole point of ditching our food was so we wouldn't have to deal with things like canyon crawlers.
So, you guys aren't going to put up your tarps?
Exactly!
Smiling. Finally, someone gets it!
Would I! Takes the meat and bites down hungrily.
Hm-hmm.
Still eating. Hmm.
That's just terrible. Looks at her piece of meat. You gonna finish that?
Yeah Katara, what are you talking about? Wei Jin didn't steal the orb, he was returning it to their village gate and was wrongfully punished by the Gan Jin.
Taking out his boomerang. We barely survived one!
Me too. I only took their side 'cause they fed me.
That's some luck you knew Jin Wei and Wei Jin.
Flabbergasted. What?
Almost throwing up. I know I should be, but, I just feel sick to my stomach. Holds his stomach.
So what about you? Are you nervous to meet this guru?
Hi, Dad.
Destructive? Buoyant? And ... Sniffs and immediately becomes disgusted. Aggh, ehhh! Terrible smelling!
Laughs. Good one, Dad!
Uhhh ... what should I do, Dad?
You don't know how much this means to me, Dad. I'll make you proud and I'll finally prove to you what a great warrior I am.
Really?
This can't be good news.
Commanding. Sh! Keep quiet!
Great job with the cloud camo, but next time, let's disguise ourselves as the kind of cloud that knows how to keep its mouth shut. He reconnoiters again.
Turning back toward the other three. Hey, we're in enemy territory. He points above as camera zooms back to show four toucan puffins standing on a rock behind him. Those are enemy birds.
Well, this is it. Cut to Sokka standing in front of the other three. This is how we'll be living until the invasion begins. His head drops each time he says the word, "cave". Hiding in cave after cave after cave after cave ...
Looks like we got outvoted, sport. Let's get some new clothes.
Come on, Aang, everyone here eats meat. Even the meat! Points at a hippo cow eating a piece of meat swarming with flies.
Springs up to his feet in shock. After what?!
With an exasperated facial expression. Enrolled in what?! Falls backward in disbelief.
Aang, I'm trying to be mature and not immediately shoot down your idea, but it sounds ... really terrible.
Impressive, I admit, but I still think it's too dangerous.
Hmm, I am a fan of secret rivers ... fine, let's stay a few more days.
To Katara. Flamey-o?
With an exaggerated accent. Fire. Stroking his beard. Wang Fire. Pointing to Katara. This is my wife, Sapphire.
Don't you worry, Mr. Headmaster. I'll straighten this boy out somethin' fierce! Turns to Aang. Young man, as soon as we get home you're gonna get the punishment of a lifetime! Aang and Katara are visibly alarmed.
Frontal shot, still acting as Wang Fire. That settles it! No more school for you, young man! Strokes his beard.
What could you possibly do for a country of depraved little fire monsters?
In Wang Fire voice. Go to your room!
Placing a candle. I can't believe we're having a dance party. It seems so ... silly.
Watching as Aang dances with On Ji. Wow, they look pretty good together.
He is seen with his Wang Fire mustache on and begins stroking it. Oh, no I can't. It's permanently glued to my skin.
Clapping lightly. Flamey-o sir, flamey-o.
Digs nuts from his bag. We've got a few options. First; round nuts. And some kind of oval shaped nuts? And some rock-shaped nuts, that might just be rocks. Throws the rock-shaped nut toward Momo. Dig in! Aang and Katara look at each other then back at Sokka.
What was that?
Aang and Katara run off-camera. Shouldn't we run away from huge booms? Not toward them?
He looks dangerous, so we better approach cautiously.
Katara and Aang chase after Haru. Hey! I worked hard to get those nuts! Momo flies overhead, chasing Katara and Aang. Yeah, I hate 'em too. Slowly follows Katara and Aang.
Sokka peeks through the window's blinds. Fire Nation! Act natural!
Door slams. Nice guy. How long has the Fire Nation been here?
Everyone should get some sleep, we're leaving at dawn.
Commandingly. Absolutely not! This village is crawling with Fire Nation troops. If they discover you're here, Aang, we'll be eating fireballs for breakfast. Goodnight.
With finality. Goodnight!
Steps beside her, taking her hand in his and laying his other hand supportively behind her shoulder. Slow down, Katara. When did this happen?
Then it's too late to track him, he's long gone.
I thought you were crazy at first, Katara, but this might work. There are ventilation shafts throughout these mines. All Aang has to do is send an air current from that vent to this one right here. The boulder levitates and ta-da! Fake earthbending.
Do you remember your cue?
Aggravated. By this, do you mean intentionally being captured by a group of ruthless firebenders?
Group of firebenders with spears approach. Here they come! Get in your places!
While angrily pointing at Katara. Get out of my way, pipsqueak! The soldiers watch in confusion. One of them even raises an eyebrow.
Just as angrily hunched over. What did you call me?
Towers over his sister. You better back off! Slips his hand by his mouth and mutters. Seriously, back off.
That's it! You're going down!
Katara and Momo each remain in their positions. Katara eyes the man in surprise. Sokka, angrily, waves his arms toward her. No, you idiot, it's the girl!
I'll hold her. Close-up. Whispers to Katara. You've got twelve hours to find Haru. We'll be right behind you.
Eyeballs Momo perched off of Aang's shoulder. Points accusingly. Momo, you have some big ears! Momo folds his ears back, hunches down, and coos in protest.
Aang stares nervously at the barge carrying Katara to the prison. She'll be fine, Aang. Katara knows what she's doing.
Your twelve hours are up; where's Haru? We've gotta get outta here!
Hurriedly. We don't have much time. There are guards everywhere. Get on!
What do you mean you're not leaving?
I say you're both crazy! The trio ducks a searching spotlight. Last chance! We need to leave, now!
Shakes his head dismally. I hate when you get like this. Come on, we better hide.
We don't have much time. What are we gonna do?
Wouldn't he just take his keys with him?
For that they'd need some kind of earth, or some rock. Something they can bend.
It should. These vents reminded me of our little trick back at the village. We're gonna do the same thing, but on a much bigger scale. The camera zooms through a visual walkthrough of Sokka's explanation. There's a huge deposit of coal at the base of the silo. And the whole system is ventilated. Aang closed off all the vents except one. When he does his airbending the coal only has one place to go, right back here.
Stay back! I'm warning you! Pulls out his boomerang, turning back-to-back with his sister.
This is gonna take forever. Throws his boomerang to simply cut the animals free.
These are Fire Nation traps, Camera zooms to upward shot of the gang looking at the trap. you can tell from the metalwork. We better pack up camp, and get moving.
Uh uh. No flying this time.
Takes the sleeping bag from Aang's hands. Think about it: Somehow Prince Zuko and the Fire Nation keep finding us. It's because they spot Appa, he's just too noticeable.
Points dramatically at Appa; condescendingly. He's a gigantic fluffy monster with an arrow on his head! It's kinda hard to miss him! The bison yawns and the camera flashes to Aang sitting comfortably on the animal's head.
Camera closes in on Sokka and Katara next to each other. I know you all wanna fly, but my instincts tell me we should play it safe this time and walk.
Points his finger at his chest; to Katara. I'm not the boss, I'm the leader.
Voice cracks. I'm the oldest, and I'm a warrior, so Deepens voice. I'm the leader!
Are you kidding, he's just a goofy kid!
Close-up on Sokka; defensively. I've kissed a girl, you just haven't met her.
Throws arms into the air. No! Besides Gran-Gran. Look, my instincts tell me we have a better chance of slipping through on foot, and a leader has to trust his instincts.
Sarcastically. Ha, ha, very funny.
Okay, okay, I get it. Look guys, I'm tired too. But the important thing is that we're safe from the Walks through a bush and sees something in front of him. Fire ... Nation.
Run! They turn to run but a firebender blocks them off by setting the plants behind them on fire. We're cut off!
If you let us pass, we promise not to hurt you.
Whispers. Bluffing?
Uh, instinct?
Hey, he was mine!
Angrily. Man!
Disdainfully. Army? There were only like, twenty guys.
Where? There's nothing here.
Skeptically. Why? What's this do? Screams as he is pulled up into the branches.
Sarcastically. Yeah, nothing's braver than a guy in a tree house.
Unfortunately, we have to leave tonight. Sokka starts walking away.
What mission?
Shh ... It amplifies vibrations.
Sokka puts his ear to the handle of his knife. Nothing yet. Whispers. Wait! Yes, someone's approaching.
I think there's just one.
Whispers. Wait, false alarm ... He's just an old man.
Jet, he's just an old man!
But he's not hurting anyone!
This doesn't feel right.
Yeah he's back. But we're leaving.
Your boyfriend Jet's a thug.
He's messed up Katara.
He beat and robbed a harmless old man!
Fine! But even if he was Fire Nation, he was a harmless civilian!
I didn't see any knife!
There was no knife! I'm going back to the hut and packing my things. Sokka stomps away.
I'm sorry Katara. Jet's very smooth, but we can't trust him.
Katara, I'm not jealous of Jet. It's just that my instinctâ
I heard your plan to destroy the Earth Kingdom town.
There are people living there, Jet; mothers and fathers and children.
You lied to Aang and Katara about the forest fire!
I do understand. I understand that there's nothing you won't do to get what you want.
You can't do this!
How can you stand by and do nothing while Jet wipes out a whole town?
If that's how Jet leads, then he's got a lot to learn. Sokka sprints off in the direction of the snares. Smellerbee makes a grab for him, but misses.
While you two are up there, you might want to practice your knot work. He holds up his now-worthless bindings, turns, and walks away.
It will be safe, without you. In shock, Jet looks up to see Sokka, Appa, and Momo rise from below the level of the cliff.
I warned the villagers of your plan, just in time.
Cuts to an illustrated set of flashback stills each being panned through. At first they didn't believe me. The Fire Nation soldiers assumed I was a spy. But one man vouched for me, the old man you attacked. He urged them to trust me, and we got everyone out in time. The flashback ends and the townsfolk are seen on high ground above the river, on the bank opposite the town. A little girl, who was seen in the flashback, runs down to the water's edge as the doll floats by. She retrieves it.
Who would be free? Everyone would be dead.
No, Jet. You became the traitor when you stopped protecting innocent people.
Yip yip. Jet is left behind, still frozen to the tree.
Shrugs his right shoulder. Hey, sometimes they're right.
And sometimes they're wrong. With a grin, he pulls Appa's reigns. They fly off screen before reappearing, going in the opposite direction.
Close-up; overwhelmed. They have buildings here that don't melt!
Somewhat seriously. You need a disguise.
Great! Now you look just like my grandfather.
Cut back to the trio; unimpressed. Great, so they get their mail on time.
Stops laughing; unsure. What? It was pretty funny.
Cut to the threesome. Sokka holds his hand for his mouth; whispering. We're in serious trouble. This guy is nuts.
Nice or not, we're prisoners!
Harshly. If you think we're going to fit through there, you're crazier than that king.
Eh, how was Appa supposed to save us anyway?
Panicking. Ah! It's already creeping!
Oh, come on!
I got it!
He's an earthbender, right? Rocky. You know, because of all the rocks.
Little help?
Why did you do all of this instead of just telling Aang who you were?
Hey, I thought designing the lost Appa poster was my job. I've been working all day on my Appa! Shows his crudely drawn picture of Appa with a proud smile. Cut to an exasperated Aang while Katara tries to hold back her laughter.
Dismayed. This is his head. PointsÂ to the sketch.
Snatches back the picture indignantly. Those are his horns. Hangs his head. I haven't seen him in a while, okay?
Thank you, I worked really- Suddenly remembering that she is blind. Why do you feel the need to do that?
They approach as Joo Dee enters. What happened to you? Did the Dai Li throw you in jail?
We can't wait around to get permission for everything.
That might come back to bite us in the blubber.
We'll split up to cover more area. Toph, I guess you should just come with me.
Katara, what is it?
But we don't even know why he's here!
How can you tell?
Looking at map. Far, very far. Puts the map on the ground as they all gather round. Here it is. It's near the South Pole, almost all the way back home.
All right, let's get moving.
We can take the train out to the wall but then we'll have to walk.
No it's not! Toph can't tell who's lying because they both think they're telling the truth. Jet's been brainwashed!
Teasingly. Maybe Katara should kiss him. That should bring something back!
Hey, just an idea!
Ooh, wait! I've got it!
Wait! Remember what Joo Dee said? She said she went on vacation to Lake Laogai!
So where's this secret headquarters?
Now that's something different.
If we keep moving, maybe we can catch up with them!
You think we can outrun them?
Yeah! Appa!
What's out here?
Makes hand motions while looking on with annoyance. Orchestra, huh? Well, la-di-da.
Annoyed. This is great and all, but don't we have more important things to worry about? We should be making plans.
There's no time for vacations.
Even if you do master all of the elements, then what? It's not like we have a map of the Fire Nation. Gestures to the side, sarcastically. Should we just head west until we reach the Fire Lord's house? Knocking on an imaginary door. Knock, knock. Hello, Fire Lord? Anybody home? I don't think so. We need some intelligence if we're going to win this war.
I don't see anything wrong with having one of those fruity beverages while we plan our strategy. Runs up to the bartender. Excuse me.
So Professor, you're obviously a well-traveled guy. Do you have a more current map? Ours seems to be a little dated.
What, no Fire Nation? Straightening his back. Doesn't anybody have a good map of that place?
Intrigued. Oh, so this spirit has attractive assistants, huh?
If this place has books from all over the world, Aang walks over to look at the maps while he sips his drink. do you think they've got info on the Fire Nation? A map, maybe?
Then it's settled. Aang, I do believe it's my turn. I'd like to spend my vacation Cut to a shot of Sokka as he points his finger into the air dramatically. The background changes to a rushing one. at the library! Sokka's voice echoes. Zoom back to a group shot, with Sokka still having his finger raised in the air.
You gotta work here a little longer before you qualify for vacation time.
Professor, would you like to see our sky bison?
Looks through his telescope and spots a tower. Pointing. Down there, what's that?
To Zei. What kind of animal is that?
Looking at the illustration Katara is holding. No, this is the library- look! Camera pans down from the tower to the illustration. It's completely buried.
That fox thingy went in through a window. I say we climb up there and give it a look.
Are you the spirit who brought this library to the physical world?
Cut to his reflection in Wan Shi Tong's eye. What? No-no-no-no destroying. We're not into that.
Um ... knowledge for knowledge's sake?
I'm not lying, I'm here with the Avatar, Grabs Aang and puts him into the shot. and he's the bridge between our worlds. He'll vouch for me. Nudges Aang.
Side shot of him walking forward. Oh, great spirit, Frontal shot of him holding a piece of string. check this out. Ties the string into a butterfly knot and shows it to Wan Shi Tong. Ta-da! Aang, Katara, and Zei look at Sokka with uncertainty.Â Shot of Wan Shi Tong just looking at him in silence. It's a special knot. That counts as knowledge!
Narrows his eyes. Bright enough to fool you.
Pulls a book off the bookshelf with the symbols å­ç½ on the cover. Eh, I've seen weirder.
Reading from the parchment. "The darkest day in Fire Nation history." It's got a date at the top, but it doesn't say anything else. He looks around, making sure no one is watching, before prying open the frame with his sword and taking the parchment.
Running down a section of a library. I want to know what happened to the Fire Nation on their darkest day. This could be promising. Aang, Katara, and Zei follow him. The information on the Fire Nation should be right up here.
That's so unfair! Just when I think I'm one step ahead of the Fire Nation, it turns out they beat us here a long time ago. Collapses on his knees. I need to know what happened on the darkest day. Hears whimpering and looks at the entrance to see the Knowledge Seeker standing on its hind legs. Hello, little weird fox guy.
Um, sure, I guess I'll follow you.
Uh, this is beautiful, but how is it helpful?
Mock whispering. Shh, Katara, not in front of the fox, he's with the owl.
Walks next to Aang. It's not broken. Shot changes to show the sun piece of the planetarium covered by the moon piece. The sun is behind the moon. It's a solar eclipse! It's literally the darkest day in Fire Nation history. Now I get it. Grabs Aang's shoulders and shakes him. Something awful happened on that day. I don't know what, but I do know why. Firebenders lose their bending during a solar eclipse. Pushes Aang back. Sorry.
To the Knowledge Seeker. Fine, you earned it. Tosses the fox a snack from his bag. To Aang and Katara. We've gotta get this information to the Earth King at Ba Sing Se. We'll wait for the next eclipse, then we'll invade the Fire Nation when they're totally helpless. The Fire Lord is going down!
You don't understand. If anyone's evil, it's the Fire Nation. You saw what they did to your library. They're destructive and dangerous. We need this information.
But we still don't know when the next eclipse is gonna to happen.
No, we won't. If we leave this place, we'll never get the information. Aang, come with me to the planetarium, Aang runs up to him. I need cover. Katara, take Momo and get out of here!
Go!
Because if this calendar can tell us about eclipses in the past, then maybe it can project when the next one will be.
Adjusting the calendar wheel. I don't have to. We just need to check every date before Sozin's Comet arrives. Because after that- well, try not to think about that.
That's it! The solar eclipse! It's just a few months away. Takes out a piece of paper and writes down the date. Got it. Now, let's get to Ba Sing Se.
That's called Sokka style. Swings his fist to the side as he says this. Learn it.
Wait! Professor, let's go.
We got it. There's a solar eclipse coming. Jumps and hugs his sister. The Fire Nation's in trouble now!
Somewhat excitedly. This is it! The official rendezvous point for the invasion force.
Before we split up, my dad and I found this island on the map. It's uninhabited, and the harbors surrounded by the cliffs seemed like the perfect secluded place.
Yawns. Whatever. That's like four days from now. Let's just calm down and-
That's okay, Aang. The eclipse will block off firebending anyway. You don't need to know it. Looking at Aang. Plus, it's a stupid element.
What? Who's talking?
What?
But that was just a dream. I'm a great climber!
Stupid Avatar! Stupid cliff! Stupid dream! I can climb fast!
Turning to look at Aang. Of course you are. That's 'cause you gotta fight the Fire Lord, the baddest man on the planet. And you better win or we're all done for.
Standing. What? It's true. That's the deal. He knows it.
In his Wang Fire voice. Why don't you get right down to business and tell me what's been bothering you.
He nods upon hearing Aang's explanation. Tell me more about this "Fire Lord". Why are you so afraid of him?
Nodding in agreement. Life does feel that way sometimes, doesn't it? Like we're all trying to save the world from evil.
While handing Aang a koala sheep. Want to try screaming into this pillow?
Then our work here is done.
Looks like it's time for another ... He turns around and puts his Wang Fire disguise on and voice. therapy session.
Hey! I'm tryin' build Appa some armor here so he doesn't have to go into the invasion naked. He's your bison.
You've been awake too long.
Confused. About what?
We made it for you. A good night's sleep will probably take the crazy away. We hope.
We all do. You can do this. You're ready.
Sorry ...
He is whittling a piece of wood. The design is indecipherable. You want me to be like you, or totally honest?
He shrugs, unconcerned with her mood. I'm saying you're an optimist. Same thing, basically.
Exuberantly. What do you mean "they're not"? Those guys are flying!
We better find some solid ground, before it finds us. The siblings land Appa on the temple courtyard, out of the hazardous sky. Aang is still flying with the boy, and seems to be having fun at the surprise competition.
Sokka ignores all formalities, instead going over to Teo's chair and examining the strange shape and design. Wow! This glider chair is incredible!
Wow! Runs up to machines.
So better!
Wait, how can you tell the time from that thing? The notches all look the same.
You put spark powder in the candle!
Horrified. Aaah!
These lanterns are terrible. I can't see! Opens the top of his lantern only to find them filled with fireflies. Why would you want to use fireflies for light? One flies out.
Nasally, due to his nose being blocked. Okay ... so you brought me all the way down here to see an empty room.
So, this place is an explosion waiting to happen.
He sniffs the air before wincing. Ugh! Week old egg smell!
How can something so small that you can't even see it make such a big stink!?
Yeah ... Both turn toward each other. if we put a whole mess of rotten eggs in the cellar where the gas seeps up ...
Then, if there's a leak ...
And plug up the hole where the gas is escaping!
Angrily. You make weapons for the Fire Nation?!
Very bad!
Thank you. You're a genius!
See, the problem with the old war balloon was you could get it air-borne, Places the candle in the model. but once it did, it just kept going. He pulls a string connected to the model, putting it on the table. You could put a hole in the top, but then all the hot air would escape. So the question became, how do you keep a lid on hot air?
A lid is actually the answer. If you control the hot air, you control the war balloon.
Okay, we've got four kinds of bombs: He begins listing them off on his fingers. smoke, slime, fire, and ...
Hey, why aren't they shooting at us?
Close-up of Sokka on war balloon. Then I guess they won't see this coming. Slices rope attached to a large bomb.
Oh no, that was the last one. Cut to tanks beginning to scale the cliffs.
Rotten eggs! Cut to a view of the balloon and a large crevice in the ground below. There! That's were the gas is escaping.
It's the only bomb we've got.
War balloon flies past. We're going down!
Cut to close-up of Sokka swinging his boomerang around with a rope attached, the mechanist behind him. Get ready!
Cut to Aang, Sokka and Katara. Aang you were right about air power. As long as we've got the skies, we'll have the Fire Nation on the run. Cut to wide-view of temple grounds, crowd cheering.
Well that explains why I can't catch a fish around here, because normally my fishing skills are off the hook! Holds up a fishing hook. The gang is unamused as Aang sits back down. Get it? Like a fishing hook? Grinning.
Hmmm ... It's doable. But that means only two potty breaks today.
It's in the middle of the river! Pointing at the village.
No, we can't waste our time here. We have a bigger mission that we need to stay focused on. These people are on their own.
Shot changes to show their argument from the river as a barrel bobs up and down. I'm not turning my back, I'm just being realistic. We can't go around helping every rinky-dink town we wander into. We'll be helping them all by taking out the Fire Lord. Aang guides Toph toward the arguing siblings.
Come on, Katara, be reasonable about this. You know our mission has to come first.
Hey, Dock. You work here too?
Picks up three fish. Carefully. We'll just take the fish. Xu takes the fish. Mind telling your brother we need a ride back to shore? Xu jumps down behind the counter and jumps up wearing Dock's hat.
Our detour into town today has completely thrown off our schedule. It's gonna take some serious finagling to get us back on track.
Well, for starters, it looks like we'll need to wake up forty-three minutes earlier every day.
Pointing to various spots on his schedule. Look, we only have a few weeks to get to the Fire Lord in time for the invasion and the eclipse, which, by the way, only lasts for eight minutes. And we just lost a whole day. So if we want to make up the time and stay on schedule, we have to wake up early!
Or we could just cut out all of our eating breaks.
Gets a sly look on his face. I got it, how's this from now on, we'll take food breaks and potty breaks at the same time.
Hey, it might be gross, but it's efficient. Either way, we have to leave here first thing tomorrow morning.
Panicking. What? Appa's sick? That's awful!
Of course I care. I might as well just throw our schedule away now. Pulls out his schedule. He stops and looks at the group. Cut to a shot of the rest of the gang giving him the evil eye, and he quickly changes his tone, rushing solicitously to Appa's side. And I'm concerned because my big, furry friend doesn't feel well.
Hey, Xu, what's going on with everyone today?
See, we don't need to help these people, they already have someone to help them. All we need is medicine for our sick friend.
Sighs. I guess you're right. You got any more food to sell?
Ponders. Two-headed! The rest of the group lowers their heads and small sweat drops appear. What? You get more for your money that way! Holds up the polluted fish.
Hi, Dock. Is Xu around?
Picks up the clams. Sarcastically. And maybe she'll cook us a midnight snack, and we'll all have a sing-along.
Well, I hope she returns every night. Otherwise this place would go right back to the way it was.
Yeah, now, but without her they wouldn't be able to fend for themselves. If she really wanted to help, she would use her spirit magic to blow up that factory. He makes mocking gestures to indicate explosive spirit magic. He crosses his arms with a smile. Katara gets even more annoyed. The screen pans to the right to show Aang who has his arms crossed not impressed.
Angrily and disappointed. Oh, really? A morning walk? Dumps the hay out of Katara's sleeping bag. I know you're the Painted Lady, I know you've been sneaking out at night, and I know you've been lying about Appa and been feeding him Sticks out his own tongue. purpleising tongue berries! Toph sticks out her tongue and shows that it is purple and holds up a bag of berries which Momo starts eating. Katara, what you did put our whole mission in jeopardy. We're leaving right now!
And how long did you know about this?
To Katara. What did you do?
You what?
I was joking! I also said to use spirit magic and made funny noises! Slaps his forehead. Did you even think this through? The army is gonna blame the villagers! They're headed there right now to get revenge!
Leave! Do nothing!
Wait! I'm coming, too.
You need me, and I will never turn my back on you.
Maybe she is a waterbender, but she was just trying to help you. Because of her, that factory won't be polluting your river, and the army is gone. You should be down on your knees thanking her!
You wouldn't mind keeping that a secret, by the way, would you?
Telling a ghost story. Suddenly, they heard something down the hall in the dark. Oooh ... It came into the torchlight ... and they knew the blade of Wing Fung was haunted! Draws sword, stands up and points it toward the fire; yells dramatically. Ooh-aaah!
Sitting down. Is this one of those "a friend of my cousin knew some guy that this happened to" stories?
Peering from behind a tree trunk. Where'd she go?
Pfft! Nice try.
Sheepishly, places arm behind head. Yes, please.
What do you mean "disappearing"?
I know, Momo. Places sword back inside holster and sets it down. This place is creepy! Lies back down on the pillow and pulls the covers over him. I don't know if I'm gonna be able to fall asleep!
People disappearing in the woods, weird stuff happening during full moons? This just reeks of Spirit World shenanigans.
Makes gesture with his hand. And then you can sew up this little mystery lickety-split, Avatar style!
Walks up to her. This is a mysterious little town you have here.
That Hama seems a little strange. Like she knows something, or she's hiding something.
But what did she mean by that comment, "mysterious children"?
I'm gonna take a look around. Walks away and up a flight of wooden stairs.
It'll be fine.
Tugging on a cupboard door. I'm not finished yet. Grunts, as he tries to pull it free. Come on ...
Just an ordinary puppet-loving innkeeper, huh? Well then why does she have a locked door up here?
We'll see. Peers through the keyhole into the room. Cuts to shot of the attic from his perspective. Through the keyhole, a small room can be seen, with a chest lying on the ground in the middle. The camera zooms in on the chest. It's empty, except for a little chest.
I have to see what's in there.
Maybe there's a key here somewhere ...
Eagerly. Come on, come on!
Suit yourself! Do it, Toph!
Surprised. An old comb?
But why didn't you tell us?
And I knew you were keeping a secret, so I guess we're both right. Grimaces as Katara hits him in the arm. But I'm sorry we were sneaking around.
So how did you end up out here?
How did you get away? And why did you stay in the Fire Nation?
Angrily. The Moon Spirit is a gentle, loving lady. She rules the sky with compassion and ... lunar goodness!
Proceeds to nail the board to the window frame. We wanted to ask you about that.
Why would a spirit want to take people to a mountain?
I can't see anything down there.
A witch? What do you mean?
Gritting. Hama!
I knew there was something creepy about her!
We know what you've been doing, Hama!
Unwillingly draws his sword. Katara, look out! Forced to walk like a puppet, while waving the blade back and forth rapidly. It's like my brain has a mind of its own! Stop it arm, stop it!
Up until now it was. Crosses arms over chest. Now Ba Sing Se is the only great Earth Kingdom stronghold left.
Aang, stop. We don't even know if Bumi's still ...
Unsurely. A-around.
A secret passage? Why didn't we just use this last time?
Ugh!
Eww!
In a panicking tone while trying to yank the pentapox off. Ahh! They won't let go! Help!
Exaggerating. Oh, it's so awful. I'm dying.
Where would they be keeping him?
Suckers!
You're all about to come down with a nasty case of pentapox.
The marks make ya look sick, but you gotta act sick too. Ya gotta sell it!
Grabs the guy who is standing next to him and points at the old man. Now that's what I'm talkin' about.
Okay everyone! Into sick formation.
No! Bad Fire Nation baby!
Annoyed. Oh ... all right.
You realize we're probably walking right into a trap.
Blows on the bison whistle before looking at his sister with a big smile. Way ahead of ya! Tom-Tom reaches for the whistle and starts to play with it.
Catching the boomerang. I seem to manage!
Gazing in the direction Katara pointed. We can catch him!
Screaming. Sneak Attack!
Simultaneously with Aang. Yes!
Look at all those messenger hawks! You know, I've been thinking about getting one for myself. That way, I wouldn't have to talk to anyone. I could just send them messages.
Sits down too. She used earthbending to win the game! Classic!
Speaking of that "third-eyed freak", I think I've come up with a name for him. What do you think of "Sparky-Sparky-Boom Man"? Silence. Just think about it.
Grabs his bag of money and his sword and stands up. Speaking of money, I'm off to spend some. See you guys later. Walks away.
Hawky, welcome to Team Avatar. My name's Sokka, and I'm your new owner, and as such I should warn you that there's already a lemur in our group, so I don't wanna see any fighting. Scratches Hawky on the stomach. Good little messenger hawky. Who's got pretty feathers? While walking away, he notices a wanted poster he had just past with Toph's picture on it. He gasps in horror and rips it off the wall. Hawky screeches. You're right, Hawky. This is bad. Suddenly, the bird poops while standing on Sokka's arm.
Toph, while I was in town, I found something that you're not gonna like. Pulls out the wanted poster and shows it to her.
It's a wanted poster. Of you. They've nicknamed you the Runaway.
Looks a few times at both the wanted poster and Toph. Well yeah, actually, it does look pretty good. Gets back on topic. But, Toph, you're missing the point. Maybe Katara was right. These scams are drawing too much attention to us.
Ponders for a moment. Well, that is true. I had this idea of making armor for Appa. Looks at Appa, who is napping, but opens one eye upon hearing this.
While taking the bag. I do like expensive atlases.
Not just a bird, a messenger bird. Now we can send messages all over the world. Even to Gran Gran.
Hm. Uh, I never actually thought about that. Hawky, Points away from himself. Gran Gran, South Pole. Hawky shakes himself. I think he gets it.
Hawky! Make nice! Bad Hawky!
Puts his hands up defensively. Hey. I'm staying out of this one.
Rests his head in his hands. I know, Hawky. Why can't they just get along?
Hey, Aang. You wanna test out my messenger hawk with me? I've got an idea.
Talks into Aang's ear. I'm going to send a note to Katara and say it's from Toph, who wants to apologize. Then everyone will be friends again.
It's a gift. Pulls out a pen and ink and a piece of paper and starts to write. "Dear Katara, sorry for everything. Your friend, Toph."
Yup. We're idiots. Hawky flies back onto his arm.
I think we're gonna run into a similar problem. Hawky screeches. Sorry, Hawky. Looks like I'm gonna have to do this without your help. Walks to Toph. Come on. We need to talk.
Nah, she's pretty much a pain. Katara, looking up at their feet from below and behind, glares and looks away. She's always got to be right about everything and she gets all bossy and involved and in your business ...
Actually, in a way, I rely on it. Katara looks back up at them.
When our mom died, that was the hardest time in my life. Our family was a mess, but Katara? She had so much strength. She stepped up and took on so much responsibility. She helped fill the void that was left by our mom.
I'm gonna tell you something crazy. I never told anyone this before, but honestly? I'm not sure I can remember what my mother looked like. It really seems like my whole life, Katara's been the one looking out for me. She's always been the one that's there. And now, when I try to remember my mom, Katara's is the only face I can picture. Katara, touched by what Sokka says, is reduced to tears.
Hey, my lips are sealed.
I was just wondering the same thing. We'd better check it out. To Hawky and Momo. You two behave. Pointing at Appa. Appa's in charge. Appa lifts his head as the two animals start screeching at each other as soon as Sokka and Aang leave, but stop as soon as Appa roars at them.
Where do you think they might be?
You know, I'm starting to think that name doesn't quite fit.
This guy is too good! He shoots fire from his brain!
Still running. Hey, I got it! The perfect name for that guy: "Combustion Man!"
See? It fits so well!
Yawns. Well, I'm exhausted. Hawky, how about you, buddy? Hawky makes a bird call. Yeah. You're such a lazy little bird.
Hey, where'd Hawky go?
Excited. The Golden Dragon Dance? Worried. But who am I going to ask? Suki? Or Princess Yue?
Looks like you got some competition there, lover boy.
Sarcastically. Sure, five thousand year-old maps from the spirit library. Just splash some water on 'em.
Okay, we just got out of the desert, so we must be around here. And we need to go to Ba Sing Se, which is here. It looks like the only passage connecting the south to the north is this sliver of land called the Serpent's Pass.
It's the only way. I mean, it's not like we have Appa to fly us there.
Then to Ba Sing Se we go. No more distractions.
Well, we are desperate.
Don't you know who this is? He's the Avatar!
All right, we scammed that lady good!
Is there a problem?
Do I know you?
Suki! Embraces her.
Ahhh, I'll grab a tree branch and do a few chin touches every now and then. Nothing major.
I can't believe we gave up our tickets and now we're going through the Serpent's Pass.
Are you sure that's a good idea?
I do, it's justâ
Nothing. I'm glad you're coming.
This is the Serpent's Pass? I thought it would be a little more wind-y, you know, like a serpent. Huh, I guess they misnamed it.
They've spotted us! Let's go, let's go!
Suki, are you okay? You have to be more careful! Come on!
Suki, you shouldn't sleep there. Who knows how stable this ledge is, it could give away at any moment! Moves her sleeping bag.
You're right, you're right, you're perfectly capable of taking care of yourself! Wait! Oh, never mind, I thought I saw a spider, but, you're fine.
Yeah, it really is.
I know you can.
It's so hard to lose someone you care about. Something happened at the North Pole and I couldn't protect someone. I don't want anything like that to ever happen again.
Jealous. Who is this guy? Is he taller than me?
Is he better-looking?
Oh!
I can't.
No, you shouldn't be. Exits.
I think I just figured out why they call it the Serpent's Pass! Suki, you know about giant sea monsters, make it go away!
Holds up Momo. Oh great and powerful sea serpent, please accept this humble and tasty offering. Thank you.
Toph, come on, it's just ice!
You're doing great! Just follow the sound of my voice!
You're almost there!
I'm coming, Toph!
There's the wall! Now it's nothing but smooth sailing to Ba Sing Se.
What's wrong?
Panicked. What? Now? Can't you hold it in or something?
This isn't the same as delivering an arctic seal! This is a real ... human ... thing!
No, no, I'm good this time. Toph and Sokka enter the tent.
It's so ... squishy looking.
See you in the big city.
Whoa, hold on. Why does it sound like you're saying goodbye?
So you came along to protect me?
Kisses Suki. You talk too much.
Sitting down on the ledge. Are you kidding? I grew up in a block of ice. It's not exactly a cultural hub.
Protesting. What's wrong? We're taking a walk!
Brightens. I know what you need. He hops off the rail to stand by her side. You need to meet my good friend, Appa.
Opening his arms out in enthusiasm. Appa and I go way back, don't we, boy? The thunder of Appa's shifting bulk is heard and Sokka's features turn to surprise. Appa enters from the left and lands on top of him and licks him, much to Sokka's dismay. Ah, ah, easy! Down boy! Agh! No, up!
You holding on tight? Yue nods; in a cool tone. Yip ... Cut to a close up of Sokka's face. yip.
Stretches. Yeah, we pretty much live up here.
Happily. Not when you're with someone.
Yeah ... The two turn to each other and slowly begin to lean in, but at the very last moment, Sokka widens his eyes, turns away and pretends to act cool again. Woo, yeah! Ahhh, good times, good times. Snow and black soot start to fall from the sky. Hey, look!
Nervous. Oh no ...
Picking up handful of black snow. Soot.
I've seen this before, right before my village was attacked. It's soot mixed with snow. Rises.
Looking out over the horizon. It's the Fire Nation. Looks at Yue concerned. They've closed in on the North Pole and from the looks of this stuff, Camera zooms out to show the enormity of the sooty snowfall. I'd say there's a lot of them.
Trying to drag her along. What's wrong? Pointing up to the citadel. We have to go!
Protesting. What? We're just friends.
You don't love him, do you? You don't even seem to like him.
Objecting. You're not marrying them.
Rising from his seat. Count me in!
Pulls his arm free from the snow. Katara!
Fire Navy uniforms don't look like that.
Sarcastically. When, like, a hundred years ago?
Walks over and flings one of the shoulder spikes with his finger. The Fire Nation doesn't wear shoulder spikes anymore. The newer uniforms are more streamlined.
His name is Zhao. Middle-aged, Tracing imaginary sideburns with his fingers. big sideburns, bigger temper ...
Stares at Hahn, mouth agape; points at him and narrows his eyes. Princess Yue's marrying you?
Turns away from Hahn, upset. Nothing. Congratulations.
Annoyed. Perks? What does that mean?
Angered. Princess Yue is wasted on a self-absorbed weasel like you!
Shouts and tackles Hahn; the two begin rolling around on the floor in a struggle. You're just a jerk without a soul, no offense!
Irritated, waves arms in gesture. It's Admiral Zhao!
Sarcastically. Oh, no. Hahn's out there on the top-secret mission while I'm here sharpening my boomerang. Everything's fine.
What, you want me to scrub the barracks?
Rises and tries to act cool. Oh ... Sure. That ... shouldn't be too hard.
What happened? Where's Zuko?
Off-camera. Where did they go ...
You did everything you could, and now we need to do everything we can to get him back. Cuts to shot of Katara who looks up at her brother, tears in her eyes. Zuko can't have gotten far. We'll find him. Aang's gonna be fine.
Yip, yip.
They're not going to die in this blizzard. If we know anything, it's that Zuko never gives up. They'll survive, and we'll find them.
Hey, this is some quality rope!
Sure we can. Let's go.
Sarcastically. Yeah, this makes a lot of sense. Let's bring the guy who's constantly trying to kill us.
Yue grabs her head as if in pain. Are you okay?
What do you mean?
No! You don't have to do that. Sokka reached to stop her.
I won't let you! Close-up of him holding her hand. Your father told me to protect you.
Yue falls as Sokka catches her. No! She's gone, she's gone.
You must be proud.
Kind of makes you realize how insignificant we are.
Oh man, Close-up. Standing. you've never not seen anything like this.
What should I do?
So what, I'm just a lemur sitter? Pets Momo; sarcastically. There, there, feel better?
Side-view of the crash site with Sokka and Momo looking left. Right. Picks up Momo and makes to move away. Staying clear, got it.
Sarcastically. Boo-hoo, Shot of Sokka from behind looking back. poor heroes. Turns away.
It's just, all you guys can do this awesome bending stuff like putting out forest fires, and flying around and Side-view of Toph, Aang and Katara. making other stuff fly around. I can't fly around, okay? View of Sokka from behind. I can't do anything.
Look, I appreciate the effort, Cut to view from behind. but the fact is each of you is so amazing and so special and I'm ... not. Side-view close-up. I'm just the guy in the group who's regular.
Side-view. Sadly. You do?
Shopping! Clapping excitedly. Runs toward the camera. Cut to side-view as he approaches to view some weapons. Maybe a little something to reinvigorate my battling. Spots some nunchaku. Hey, how about these? Frontal view of Sokka. Sokka tests the nunchaku, making attacking noises, but he hits himself on the head and falls into some of the other weapons.
Close-up. Ooh! Walks to the sword. Side-view of Sokka inspecting the sword. That's what Sokka's talking about.
A sword?
Close-up. Pulling out the blade, inspecting it. It would be nice to be a master sword fighter. All right, I'll talk to him.
I've come to train with the master.
Frontal view. Well, uhh ... Feels around, patting his clothes for something to offer.
Master, my name is Sokka, and I wish to be instructed in the way of the sword.
Frontal view. Nervously. Oh, uh, really, uh where I come from, the Fire Nation colonies, it's a pretty normal name ... for Fire Nation colonials.
Frontal view. Well, actually, I've been all over the world.
Frontal view. And I know one thing for sure: Gets down on his knees and hangs his head. I have a lot to learn.
Side-view of room. I know. Your butler told me that when I met you, I would have to prove my worth. Close-up. But the truth is ... I don't know if I am worthy.
Close-up. Like a second head.
Close-up. Skeptical. Writing my name will make me a better swordsmanâ?
Frontal view of both. I am? Looks at the brush. I am! So this is about putting my identity on the page, right?
I'm finished!
Frontal view. Worried. Is that okâay?
Hm, manipulate them to my advantage ... oh!
Hey, would you mind grabbing a cold drink for meâ?
Frontal view. I haveâ? But I thought I messed up every single thing we worked on!
Frontal view. Excited. Are you giving me one of yoursâ?
Master, Side-view of Sokka looking at Piandao. would it be possible for me to leave and bring back a special material for my swordâ?
Hey, guys. What are you doingâ?
Close-up. Confused. Funny howâ?
Side-view of Sokka with Toph in the foreground. To Toph. What's their dealâ?
Overhead side-view of group. Thanks. That warms my heart. Anyway, I need some help.
Overhead view from behind Piandao. Oh, these are my friends. Just other good Fire Nation folks. They bow to Piandao. Cut to Piandao, who bows back. The camera zooms out to show the meteorite and Sokka. Do you think we can make a sword out of a meteoriteâ?
I'm sorry, Master. You're wrong. Close-up of Piandao. I am not worthy. Side-view of Sokka. I'm not who you think I am. I'm not from the Fire Nation. I'm from the Southern Water Tribe. Cut to side-view of Aang, Katara, and Toph who all gawk at Sokka with shock and disbelief. Close-up side-view of Piandao and Sokka. I lied so that I could learn swordsmanship from you. I'm sorry. Offering his sword back.
No, this is my fight, alone.
It's a Pai Sho tile.
Cut to close-up of Aang and Sokka as Fat is seen in the background closing the doors. Sokka and Aang look back and the camera zooms in on the doors, clearly showing a lotus design on the doors surrounding the Fire Nation symbol. I have no idea. Overhead view. Sokka reaches into his pocket. Ooh, that reminds me! Toph, I thought you might like this Close-up view of Sokka offering her a chunk of the meteorite. since you've probably never had a chance to bend space earth before.
Must you ruin everythingâ?
Grunting sleepily. Uggh! Sleep now. Temple later.
He lazily opens one eye before yelling out in horror. Ahh! He quickly rises and hops around, still inside the sleeping bag. Get it off! Get it off! After two hops, Sokka slams flat to the ground. Ahh!
Annoyed. Hey, stomach? Be quiet, all right? I'm trying to find us some food.
Accusingly to the two in front of him. Hey! Who ate all of my blubbered seal jerky?!
Shocked. You what?! Looks up before slanting his eyes and groans. Longing. No wonder the flames smelled so good.
So where do I get something to eat?
I'm just a simple guy, with simple needs.
Cheerfully trying to distract Aang from his sadness. So uh, this airball game. How do you play?
Painfully. Making him feel better is putting me in a world of hurt. He erects himself, but before he gets up completely, his eyes widen when he sees something in front of him and he crawls to the front. The camera shifts to reveal an old Fire Nation helmet lying in the snow. It has been battered by the elements, and shows signs of cracks and burns. He looks up at his sister. Katara, check this out.
We should tell him.
Brushes the last of the snow from his head and shoulders. You know, you can't protect him forever.
Arms crossed; stern. Katara, firebenders were here. You can't pretend they weren't.
Who's that?
Appears in screen from behind Aang's back. Katara and Aang look surprised at him. Eagerly. And whoever's in there might have Katara's look changes to one of annoyance. Close-up of Sokka's determined, anticipating face. a medley of delicious He rubs his hands together and practically starts to drool over the thought. cured meats!
I don't suppose you have a key?
Disappointed. Statues? That's it? Where's the meat?
Skeptically. Past lives? Aang stops before a statue while Sokka and Katara are still visible in the background. Katara, you really believe in that stuff?
You were a firebender? No wonder I didn't trust you when we first met.
Growls irritably while crossing his arms. You just couldn't get any weirder.
Whispering. Firebender. Nobody make a sound.
Whispering. That firebender won't know what hit him.
Quickly pans to a drooling Sokka. Dinner!
Aang glares angrily at Sokka, before the scene switches to a close-up of his drooling face. Challenging. Not if I get him first!
I want to eat you!
Hey! No fair!
Happily. Hey, Aang! You find my dinner yet? Cut to a side-view of Aang sitting on his knees, his head cupped in his hands. Sokka walks toward him. Reassuring. Aang, I wasn't really going to eat the lemur, okay? He approaches Aang with a smile on his face, but shakes his head and does a double take. Oh, man. Switch to a shot of the skeleton of the monk, which slowly moves back to reveal that Sokka places a hand on Aang's shoulder. Come on, Aang. Everything will be all right. Let's get out of here.
Alarmed. Aang! Come on! Snap out of it!
Aaaaahh!
Shouting. He found out firebenders killed Gyatso!
Holds on to the rock in an attempt to keep from being blown away. Alarmed. Well, do it! Before he blows us off the mountain!
Gently. Katara and I aren't going to let anything happen to you. Promise.
Pushing the food in his mouth with his two hands. Looks up with an exhilarated look upon his face. With a full mouth. Can't talk! Must eat! Takes another big bite.
Come on! We've gotta get out of here!
We need to split up. To the others. Take the tunnel and get to the stolen airship.
Holding up his cup. To Zuko! Who knew after all those times he tried to snuff us out, today he'd be our hero?
What's with her?
Voice-over. What's with him?
Holding a rose in his mouth, surrounded by lit candles. Well, hello ... Surprised to find Zuko in his tent, destroying the rose in his mouth. Uh, Zuko! Yes, why would I be expecting anyone different? Painfully swallows rose petals and thorns. So what's on your mind?
Nah, she doesn't hate you. Katara doesn't hate anyone. Except maybe some people in the Fire Nation. His eyes widen as he realizes his mistake. No, I mean, uh, not people who are good, but used to be bad. I mean, bad people. Fire Nation people who are still bad, who've never been good and probably won't be, ever!
Slightly taken aback. What? Why would you want to know that?
Sadly. It's not a day I like to remember.
Voice-over. Many of the warriors had seen the black snow before and they knew what it meant: a Fire Nation raid. A battle scene is depicted of Water Tribe Warriors and Fire Nation soldiers charging and attacking one another. We were badly outnumbered, but somehow, we managed to drive them off. As quickly as they came, they just left.
I was so relieved when it was over, but that's because I didn't know yet what had happened. I didn't know we had lost our mother.
Yeah ... sea ravens. Scene shows flashback of three red flags waving in the breeze, bearing sea ravens. The main ship had flags with sea ravens on them.
Urging Zuko hurriedly out of the tent. No problem. Thanks for stopping by! Zuko leaves. I'd thought he'd never leave. Peaks head out excitedly and whispers. Suki!
Katara, she was my mother, too, but I think Aang might be right.
Hurt. Katara!
You know, you're pretty wise for a kid.
Cuts to shot of the two standing together looking up. Usually it's annoying, but right now, I'm impressed.
So, can I borrow Momo for a week?
Maybe Zuko's right. Sitting around the house has made us pretty lazy. But I know Lays his watermelon aside and stands up slowly. just the thing to change all that. Takes off his robe, revealing a bathing suit. Beach party!
Reveals a grotesque looking sculpture with seaweed for hair, a starfish for a nose, and rocks and shells for eyes and mouth. Ta da!
Defensively. No, it's Suki!
While rebuilding his sculpture. Zuko's gone crazy! I made a sand sculpture of Suki and he destroyed it! Pauses a moment. Oh, and he's attacking Aang.
Honestly, if Aang tries to fight the Fire Lord now, he's going to lose. Aang looks over to Sokka as he says this, frowns, and closes his eyes in defeat. To Aang. No offense.
I always knew the Fire Lord was a bad guy, but his plan is just pure evil.
All right! Team Avatar is back! Air. Shot of Aang. Water. Shot of Katara. Earth. Shot of Toph. Fire. Shot of Zuko. Sokka gives Suki a clump of leaves and holds up a large leaf. Fan and sword! Sokka's leaf wilts.
All right.
Gather round, Team Avatar. Puts a carved melon on a draped mannequin. In order to take out the Fire Lord - or in this case, the Melon Lord - our timing has to be perfect. Kneels down on the ground and uses a stick to draw a line heading toward the Melon Lord symbol. First, Suki and I will draw his fire. Then, Katara and Zuko charge in with some liquidy hot offense, Draws another line. and while the Melon Lord is distracted, Draws a third line. Aang swoops in ... and bam! Destroys the Melon Lord symbol with the line. He delivers the final blow.
For now, you're the Melon Lord's forces.
Whatever makes the training feel more realistic.
Watch it, Toph!
Now, Aang!
Walks up to Aang. What's wrong with you? If this was the real deal, you'd be shot full of lightning right now.
Off-camera. There, that's how it's done.
Sure you can. You're the Avatar. If it's in the name of keeping balance, I'm pretty sure the universe will forgive you.
Okay, that's everything.
He left his staff. Picks up the staff. That's so strange.
Look, there's his footprints. The camera pans up toward Aang's footprints, which stop at the beach. The trail ends here.
I don't think so. Examining the footprints. There's no sign of a struggle.
Uh-uh. He left behind his glider and Appa.
It's pretty obvious. Aang mysteriously disappears before an important battle? He's definitely on a Spirit World journey.
Downcast. Oh, yeah. Forgot about that.
Judging by the looks on your faces, I'm guessing you guys didn't find Aang, either. Jumps off Appa.
Turns back to Appa. Oh no! I knew it was only a matter of time! Jumps down to Appa. Appa ate Momo! Lifts up Appa's mouth. Momo, I'm coming for you, buddy.
That's just what Appa wants you to think. Climbs into Appa's mouth.
Zuko, I don't wanna tell you how to do your job, but why are we heading towards the Earth Kingdom? There's no way Aang's there.
Off-camera. Oh yeah, that weird bounty hunter with the giant mole.
No, she has this giant mole creature she rides around on.
To Zuko. Hey, I remember her! Cut to frontal view of Zuko, Sokka standing behind. She helped you attack us!
To June. What do you mean Aang doesn't exist? Side-view of the group. Do you mean he's ... you know, dead?
You saved your uncle's sweaty sandal? Ugh! Pinches nose even tighter.
Runs up and hugs Pakku. Camera zooms in on Pakku. Welcome to the family, Gramp-Gramp!
Frontal view. How about Grand-Pakku?
Side-view. Bows to Piandao. Master Piandao.
Side-view. Leaning backward almost all the way, as Bumi is right in his face. He's gone. Pauses. And so is Aang.
So, Bumi ... Cut closer, side-view. Camera follows them as they walk. how did you end up escaping your imprisonment in Omashu?
Nonchalantly. No, not really.
What about us? Side-view of Toph with Sokka sitting to the right and behind. What is our destiny today?
Frontal view. I think that, even though we don't know where Aang is, we need to do everything we can to stop the airship fleet.
He puts the map away. Thank you, Master.
We're too late! The fleet's already taking off!
It's right ... Points to the closest airship.
Backed against the wall. Sshhh ...
Good work, Toph! Time to take control of the ship, take the wheel.
I was talking to Suki.
Take us down closer to the water. I've got an idea. Grabs a tube-like speaker. Attention, crew, this is your captain speaking. Everyone please report to the bomb bay immediately for hot cakes and sweet cream. We have a very special birthday to celebrate.
Fire Lord Ozai, here we come.
We're not gonna catch up to him in time.
Excited. It's Aang! He's back!
Excited. Go, Aang! Airbending slice! Swings hand down, slicing through the air.
The Fire Lord is Aang's fight. We need to stay focused on stopping that fleet from burning down the Earth Kingdom.
Smiles as he comes up with his idea before turning to face Suki and Toph; excitedly. Airship slice!
It's gonna be a rough ride! We need to get to the top of this thing, fast.
Watch each other's backs, and if we make it that far, I'll let you know.
Suki!
Heartbroken. No ... â
Toph, metalbend the rudder so it's jammed in a turning position. The ship will spiral and slam into the others.
Have I ever mentioned how sweet it is that you invented metalbending?
In pain. My leg! Hang on Toph!
Sadly. Bye, space sword.
I don't think boomerang's coming back, Toph. It looks like this is the end. Toph starts crying and the firebenders run away. The airship gets struck by a different one and Sokka lets Toph fall onto it before jumping down himself, hurting his leg again in the process. He falls over in pain.
Looking up. No, Suki did. They see Suki riding on the last functioning airship with a triumphant smile.
You did it! You should've seen yourself, it was amazing! You were all like Pretends to be Aang fighting Ozai while adding sound effects. and the Fire Lord was all like Pretends to be Ozai struggling and groaning.
Well, look at you, buster. Now that your firebending's gone I guess we should call you the Loser Lord.
There's my favorite warriors! I have to admit, I kind of missed the face paint. So how does it feel to be in uniform again?
Protects Suki and points his crutch at Ty Lee. Careful, Suki! Ty Lee is pretending to be a Kyoshi Warrior again.
Zuko, stop moving! I'm trying to capture the moment. I wanted to do a painting, so we always remember the good times together.
Those are your hair loopies!
I thought it looked more exciting that way. Momo jumps on to the table and chitters. Oh, you think you can do a better job, Momo? Momo chitters again as Aang goes outside.
Drowsily. What's going on? He looks around. Did we get captured again?
Curls up, facing away from Aang. Don't have to tell me twice.
Sitting up behind Katara; upbeat. You guys want to hear about my dream? Katara glares at him, an expression Sokka returns. That's okay. I didn't want to talk about it anyway.
Side-shot as he suddenly straightens up, his tone serious. Guys, wait. This was in my dream. Momo lands on the pack behind him. We shouldn't go to the market.
Frontal shot; his eyes are bugged out in terror and the camera zooms in on him, rolling slightly as the shot takes on a greenish tint and alien music dubs the scene. Food eats people! The colors return to normal as the shot cuts to Katara's face as she shakes her head. Behind her, Aang goes back to adjusting the reins. Cut to Sokka again as he points at Momo. Also, Momo could talk. He glares at Momo while crossing his arms. You said some very unkind things.
Out of food and out of money. Now what are we supposed to do?
Indicating the fair weather. Are you kidding? Shelter from what?
Interrupting, raising his hand. I'll go.
After a short pause, to Katara and Aang. What? You said get a job ... and he's paying double.
I said I was going to do this job. I can't back out just because of some bad weather.
Hey! They left without saying good-bye!
I know! This one time, I was ...
I'm too young to die!
Seriously, you're still going to pay me, right?
Do you hear that? It stopped raining.
Puts a finger of Tho's mouth to quiet him. Pay attention, simpleton. This ... Camera pans to show a hollowed out pumpkin with two leaves on top. is a water filtration device. Runs over to it. See, your filthy swamp water sits in this hollowed-out pumpkin. Then the sunlight makes the water evaporate, leaving behind the swampy impurities.
Sarcastically. Yes, genius. It leaves behind the filthy swamp flavor. Then the clean water vapor collects on the leaf, and drips into this nice, sanitized cup. Holds up the cup and takes a refreshing drink. Ah! I do love clean water.
Very angrily. What do you think I'm going to do, leaf head?! I'm going to rebuild my water filtration device!
But ...
Flatly. No.
Guys, can I get out of the water now?
I-I ... I did it! I'm swamp skiing! His eyes make heart symbols. I love swamp skiing ...! The camera pans back to the whole world and back to Sokka. Aang swings by, smiling. In your face, air boy. Who's swamp skiing now?
Falling down the trunk of the tree. I hate swamp skiing.
To Aang. Hey, you taking us down for a reason? Aang continues to stare at the swamp. Aang, Aang snaps out of the trance. why are we going down?
Are you noticing now?
Holding his stomach. Is it telling you where we can get something to eat?
Shrugging. No offense to the swamp, but I don't see any land there to land on.
Yes.
See, even Appa and Momo don't like it here.
Panicked. You better throw in an extra "yip"! We gotta move!
He spins around, panicking, trying to find it. Where? Where?
Ripping off the elbow leech and throwing it behind to Katara. He cries out angrily. Why do things keep attaching to me?!
Cutting the vines with his machete. We better speed things up.
Continuing to cut the vines. Aang, these are just plants. Do you want me to say "please" and "thank you" as I swing my machete back and forth?
I'm sure there are lots of things that are alive here and if we don't wanna wind up getting eaten by them, we need to find Appa as fast as we can.
There's no way they can hear us and no way we can see them. We'll have to make camp for the night.
Nothing, just swamp gas. Indicating. Look, there's nothing supernatural going on here.
Sweating, his voice cracking. I think we should build a fire.
No, I asked the swamp. It said this was fine. Grabs a nearby root. Right, swamp? Shakes the root and fakes a reply. "No problem, Sokka!"
Please, we're all alone out here.
His calm demeanor vanishing. Right, except for them.
Aang! While slashing at the vines. Stupid swamp! Dumb, ugly vines! Katara! He becomes caught, and grunts with exertion before slicing himself free. You think you're so tough, huh?
Hello? Yue? He takes a hold of his head, before removing his hands and shrugging, turning away from the apparition. This is just a trick of the light ... swamp gas ... I ... hit my head running away last night. I'm going crazy. Almost fearfully, he turns around and walks closer.
He stands up and puts his machete away. What do you guys think you're doing!? I've been looking all over for you!
Sarcastically, with exaggerated hand movements. Well, there must be a tea party here and we just didn't get our invitations!
Look, we were all just scared and hungry and our minds were playing tricks on us. That's why we all saw things out here.
He looks away for a moment, before turning back and taking a step closer to his sister. I thought I saw Yue. But, that doesn't prove anything. Look, I think about her all the time, and you saw Mom, someone you miss a lot.
It's just a tree. He raises his arms above his head. It can't call anyone. For the last time, there's nothing after us and there's nothing magical happening here.
There's someone in there! He's bending the vines!
He's the Avatar. Stuff like that happens to us a lot.
See, completely reasonable. He finally puts his machete away. Not a monster, just a regular guy defending his home. Nothing mystical about it.
Humoring Huu. Sure you did. It seems real chatty.
Sorry to interrupt the lesson, but we still need to find Appa and Momo.
Huu?
Tastes just like arctic hen. So why were you guys so interested in eating Appa? He indicates the catgator lying behind Tho. You've got plenty of those big things wandering around.
Nice Slim!
To Katara. Well, I hope you realize now that nothing strange was going on here. He raises his arms for emphasis. Just a bunch of greasy people living in a swamp.
I told you, we were hungry. I'm eating a giant bug!
That's Avatar stuff, that doesn't count. To Huu. The only thing I can't figure out is how you made that tornado that sucked us down.
Well, no accounting for weather. Still, there's absolutely nothing mysterious about the swamp.
What's this?
Looking pleased. Ahh, poetry.
Collecting himself and removing the window frame. I am so sorry. Something struck me in the rear. I just ... wound up ... here.
Thinking for a moment. They call me Sokka, that is in the Water Tribe. Counting five syllables on his fingers. I am not an oaf. The ladies laugh at his haiku.
You think you're so smart, with your fancy little words, this is not so hard.
I calls it easy. Like I paddle my canoe, I'll paddle yours too! Turns around and paddles his behind, as the ladies laugh.
Making arm movements. Squish, squash, sling that slang. I'm always right back at ya, like my ... He draws his boomerang. boomerang! The class laughs.
Making more arm movements. That's right, I'm Sokka, it's pronounced with an "okka", young ladies, I rocked ya!
Poetry ...
Frontal view. You idiot! We're about to die!
Frontal view. Aang, do something!
Side-view. To Kya. It won't be long until the Fire Nation sends their whole fleet after your little boyfriend. Frontal view of Kya. Kya, we don't have time for this.
Frontal view of Kya. Hey! Quit playing around!
Close-up. Blushing. I was six.
What's your problem, air boy?
That was going to be our lunch.
Poking Aang with the tip of his boomerang. So find it. I'm hungry.
Frontal view. He leaves, pushing Aang out of his way. Right, so once again, I have to do everything. Camera pans left as he leaves and Momo lands on Aang's shoulder. Wide-view of the beach with Sokka in the foreground as he exits to the left. You better hope I find some food or you'll find me eating Momo.
To Zuko. Hey! Close-up aerial view of Zuko, with Sokka, tied up behind next to two soldiers. Untie me and fight like a real warrior! Frontal view. I'm talking to you, scar boy! Close-up of Zuko's scar as becomes visibly annoyed. Frontal view of Sokka as the two soldiers slide away. Muttering. Yeah, tie me up with ropes.
Turning to Kya. Kya!
Frontal view. Yep, we're dead.
Cut to Sokka's perspective as he looks up at the hole above. Frontal view. As long as he distracts those soldiers, I can get us out of here.
Frontal view. Muttering to himself. Stupid short firebender ropes and stupid short Aang. Kya begins to enter waterbending stance. Cut to an aerial view of the container above as the water begins to shift. Cut to a frontal view of Kya. What are you doing? This isn't time to practice. I can't believe this, you never listen to me. Kya concentrates and ignores her brother. You're just off in your own little waterbending world, bending water in its world like ways. You never listen!
Voice-over. Stay back!
Kya, get ready.
To Aang. You have no idea where you're going, do you?
Sarcastically. I guess we're getting close then.
Cut to shot of Katara and Sokka seated on Appa's saddle. Sokka waves his arm breezily at Aang as if he is trying to shoo him away. Stop bugging her, airhead. You need to give girls space when they do their sewing.
Cut to a shot of Sokka lazily resting with his arms behind his head. Simple. Girls are better at fixing pants than guys and guys are better at hunting and fighting and stuff like that. Cut back to an annoyed Katara. It's just the natural order of things.
Protesting and pleading. Wait! I was just kidding. Sticks one arm through the large hole in his pants. I can't wear these! Katara, please!
We just made a pit stop yesterday. Shouldn't we get a little more flying done before we camp out?
Aang smiles over his shoulder at the duo. Sarcastically. Yeah, that was real convincing.Somewhat fearfully. Still, hard to argue with a ten-ton magical monster.
Unimpressed. Are you kidding? Lazily gestures at Aang in the water. The fish is doing all the work.
Alarmed. There's something in the water!
Aang's in trouble. Aang!
Get back here, Aang!
Stands up and wipes his hands together. Well, let's not stick around to find out. Time to hit the road.
Or, we could stay a while.
Close-up of the blindfolded Sokka. Challenging. Show yourselves, cowards!
Aggressively. Who are you? Where are the men who ambushed us?
Closer side-view shot of Sokka who stares at them in disbelief. Wait a second, He amusingly glance to his right to where Aang stands as if he is looking for confirmation. Mockingly. there's no way that a bunch of girls took us down.
Not hungry.
Protesting. They snuck up on me!
Indignant. Sneak attacks don't count! Walks out of the scene with big strides. Mumbling to himself. Tie me up with ropes! I'll show them a thing or two. Comes back to the table to face Katara and Aang. Momo grabs some more pastries that lie around him. I'm not scared of any girls. Snatches some of the desert of the table. Who do they think they are anyway? He shoves one of the deserts in his mouth and stalks off again. Mmm ... this is tasty.
Angrily grunting to himself. I can't believe I got beat up by a bunch of girls.
Condescending. Sorry ladies, Suki and the other warriors stop their exercise and close their fans. They stare at Sokka with a serious look on their faces. didn't mean to interrupt your dance lesson. The camera moves back, revealing that Sokka was stretching. I was just looking for somewhere to get a little workout?
Stretching his arms. It's all right. Mockingly suppressing a laugh while speaking. I mean, normally I'd hold a grudge, but seeing as you guys are a bunch of girls, I'll make an exception.
Smugly. True. But don't feel bad. After all, I'm the best warrior in my village.
Frontal view of Sokka as his eyes widen upon hearing the unexpected request. Oh ... Well ... I mean ... I ...
Well, if that's what you want, I'd be happy to. He places his hands on Suki's shoulder in order to push her back a little, but she does not move a bit. All right, you stand over there. Now, this may be a little tough, but try to block me.
Rubbing his hurt right shoulder. Impressed. Aw! Heh heh ... Good. Of course, I was going easy on you.
He starts with a mumble, raising his tone of voice with each word. Let's see if you can Shouting while he attempts to hit Suki with a roundhouse kick. handle this!
His voice cracking in anger. That does it!
Timidly. Uh ... Hey, Suki.
Cut to a shot of Sokka who does not know how to act. No ... I ... well, let me explain.
Sokka looks hurt at Suki's hostility. He humbly drops to his knees in front of her. I would be honored if you would teach me.
Averting his eyes. I'm sorry if I insulted you earlier. I was ... wrong.
Raises his head to face her; pleading. Please make an exception. Bowing again. I won't let you down.
Close-up; eagerly. Of course!
Embarrassed looking down at his wardrobe. Do I really have to wear this? It feels a little ... Lower his arms in defeat. girly.
Proudly. Bravery and honor.
I think I'm starting to get it.
Tah!
Looks surprised, quickly crosses his arms and looks smug. Hmm ...
Points at Suki, exclaims ecstaticly. I got you! Admit I got you!
Protesting. Hey, I'm not a ... Momo jumps on his shoulder and pushes himself off toward the door. Conceding. oh, whatever!
I guess training's over.
What about, "I'm sorry?"
Close-up. Regretful. I treated you like a girl when I should've treated you like a warrior.
Hanging lazily over the back of Appa's saddle; grumpily. I'm not one to complain, Side-view shows Appa flying just above the water. but can't Appa fly any higher?
Back-view of Sokka looking over his shoulder; sarcastically. I'd love to. Points to his back. Climb on everyone, Shakes his rear. Sokka's ready for take off.
Frontal shot, Momo is now on his lap; annoyed. And for what? We can't even find the Northern Water Tribe. Cut to a wide side-shot, revealing Appa floating along a vast ocean of only water and ice. There's nothing up here.
Surprised. We're finally here.
Yeah ... she is ...
Hi there. Sokka, Southern Water Tribe.
Nervously. So ... uhhh ... you're a princess, huh? She nods and smiles. You know, back in my tribe, I'm kind of like a prince, myself. Shot pans left to reveal Katara.
A lot of things! Do you mind? I'm trying to have a conversation here.
So, it looks like I'm going to be in town for a while. I'm thinking ... maybe we could ... do an activity, together?
Princess Yue, good morning! How about that picnic last night? Boy, your dad sure does know how to throw a party.
Well, it wasn't as much fun after you left. They both blush. So, I'm still hoping we can see more of each other.
Yes ... at a place ... for some time.
Great! I'll see youâ Ah! Falls into the water.
Climbs out of the water. That's okay, it was worth it. See you tonight.
Hi, Princess Yue. I made you something. I carved it myself.
Actually, it's supposed to be a fish. Flips the carved creature around. See, it has a fin.
No, it's Princess Yue. I don't get it, one minute she wants to go out with me, and the next, she's telling me to get lost. Changing the topic. So, how's waterbending training?
Why don't you just teach her, Aang?
I'm not happy.
Yeah, I think she did.
Are you crazy, Katara? You're not going to win this fight!
Nothing. I just want you to know, I think you're beautiful, and, I never thought a girl like you would even notice a guy like me.
No, no. See, that's the thing. I think I do understand now. You're a Princess, and I'm ... I'm just a Southern peasant.
It's okay. You don't have to say anything. I'll see you around, okay? Yue grabs him and kisses him. Okay, now I'm really confused. Happy, but confused.
Aang is pacing around on Appa's saddle, breathing heavily. Would you sit down? Turns around from his perch on Appa's head. If we hit a bump, you'll go flying off. What's bugging you anyway?
In a sarcastic, amused tone while facing Aang. Well, let's see. You pretty much mastered airbending and that only took you a hundred and twelve years. I'm sure you can master three more elements by next summer.
Grinning; sarcastically. Maybe we can find a puddle for you to splash in.
Frowning beside Aang and Katara's ecstatic faces. Nice puddle.
Sarcastically. Great. So what am I supposed to do?
Frowns and crosses his arms. So, while you guys are playing in the water, I'm supposed to be hard at work picking mud out of a giant bison's feet?
Okay. Takes stick and walks over to Appa who is floating in the water.
Yeah, don't get too happy. You've got to do me next. Appa moans happily.
Still working on cleaning up Appa, he looks up and stares at Aang's wave crashing toward him in fear. Aang?! The wave throws Sokka off into the water and his head slowly rises out, annoyed.
Head still sticking out of the water. Yeah, I'll say! Points to the left. You just "practiced" our supplies down the river. Shows a group of bags floating away.
My life was hard enough when you were just an airbender. Sinks back underwater.
Walking back from alleyway with a bag over his shoulders. We've got exactly three copper pieces left from the money that King Bumi gave us. Let's spend it wisely.
Pulls out fingers over his ears after expecting a loud noise. It doesn't even work. Aang stops blowing when Momo squawks at him. See? Even Momo thinks it's a piece of junk.
Turns around and looks at the captain from the other side of the room. Wait a minute ... Sea loving traders, with suspiciously acquired merchandise, Raises eyebrows, almost yelling. and pet reptile birds? Turns around to Oh, almost spitting in his face. You guys are pirates!
Yeah, I was just starting to browse through their boomerang collection.
Turning a corner with Aang and Katara. Whoa! Katara freezes a puddle behind them that a pirate slips on.
No wonder they were trying to hack us up! You stole their waterbending scroll!
It doesn't matter. You put all of our lives in danger just so you could learn some stupid, fancy splashes.
Walks away. Whatever.
Ha, ha, ha!
I'm sorry, but you deserved that. To Aang. You've been duped; she's only interested in teaching herself.
What about Momo? He's the real victim here.
And what about me? There was that time youâ
Notices Katara's missing. Huh? Where did she go? Looks through the bag. I don't believe it.
She took the scroll! She's obsessed with that thing. It's just a matter of time before she gets us all in deep- Yells as a pirate throws a rope around his arms and drags him forward. He rolls away and charges at the pirate while another pirate captures Aang in a net and drags him away.
Oh, what? I'm not good enough to kidnap? Ah! The pirate shoots another net at Sokka and drags him away too.
You're really gonna hand over the Avatar for a stupid piece of parchment?
Sure is, and I'll bet he'll fetch a lot more on the black market than that fancy scroll.
I'm just sayin' it's bad business sense. Think how much the Fire Lord would pay for the Avatar. You guys would be set for life.
Shouting. Aang, are you there?
Where? I can't find you!
We'd need a team of rhinos to budge this ship.
I don't know how. This thing wasn't made by the Water Tribe!
Would you two quit congratulating each other and help me out?
Have you lost your mind? This is no time for flute practice! Katara and Aang stare in horror at the approaching waterfall.
But we have another problem. Zuko's boat is shown sailing straight toward their ship. The boat rams into the ship and Sokka, Aang, and Katara are forced to jump as the boat goes over the falls.
Yeah, we owe you one. Appa roars and the scene cuts to show Zuko running to the cliff in horror at the fact that his boat has gone over the falls.
Holding the scroll. Sarcastically. Is that really how you feel?
Puts his hand in front to keep Katara from grabbing it. First, what did you learn?
Looking up at her. You mean getting thoroughly spanked by the Fire Nation or having to walk all the way to the Western Air Temple?
I miss not having blisters on my feet.
Well, if you ask me, the new plan is the old plan! You just need to master all four elements and confront the Fire Lord before the comet comes.
There's gotta be someone who can teach him firebending.
Aang, I think we should be making some plans about our future!
Not really, since you've followed us all over the world.
Yeah, all you've ever done is hunt us down and try to capture Aang!
He probably just covered himself in honey or something so that Appa would lick him. I'm not buying it.
Like when you attacked our village?
Pulls out his boomerang; angrily. Wait, you sent Combustion Man after us?
Sarcastically. Ohhh, sorry. I didn't mean to insult your friend!
Either you leave, or we attack.
Obviously he wants to lead us into some kind of trap.
He wants you to trust and feel sorry for him so you let your guard down, then he strikes.
And you made us suck on frozen frogs? How could I forget? I had a wart on the flap that hangs down from the back of my throat for a month!
I could feel it! It's my throatal flap!
Yeah, face it Aang, you're nothing but a big prize to him.
Sarcastically. Oh, hooray! In a lifetime of evil, at least he didn't add animal cruelty to the list.
Or when he burned down Kyoshi Island!
You're darn right you're not, buddy.
I haven't seen her since she stormed off yesterday.
Sitting. Let her have fun with her rocks. I'm in no rush to have her yelling at us again.
Uhhh ...!
So he attacked you?
See? You trusted Zuko, and you got burned. Literally!
Zuko's clearly too dangerous to be left alone. We're gonna have to go after him.
He's crafty, but we'll find a way to capture him.
Yeah, get him to come back and say he'll be our prisoner, then we'll jump him and really make him our prisoner. He'll never suspect it! Aang and Sokka carry Toph away.
Pausing for a moment to think before having an idea. I know how to get an angle on him! Takes out his boomerang. After another blast, he sneaks his head out, but has to hide from another shot. He projects Combustion Man's angle with his boomerang. All right buddy, don't fail me now! Throws his boomerang.
Yeah, boomerang! Jumps up and grabs it, but Combustion Man gets up, albeit clearly shaken. Awww, boomerang ...
Hey, what about me? I did the boomerang thing.
Shrugging. Hey, all I want is to defeat the Fire Lord. If you think this is the way to do it, then, I'm all for it.
So, here you go, home sweet home, I guess, you know, for now. Unpack? Lunch, soon? Uhhh ... welcome aboard? Zuko glances back and smiles at him. Yeah. Walks out of the room and meets Aang in the hallway; to Aang. Okay, this is really, really weird.
Turns to Katara; mockingly with a smile. Maybe you should give it a try.
Camera zooms in. It's like a scar ...
Voice-over. Listen. Cut to a frontal shot of a sad-looking Aang, his friends behind him. It's so quiet. There's no life anywhere.
Noticing footprints; angrily. Fire Nation! Those evil savages make me sick! They have no respect for -
Whispering angrily. What? I'm not allowed to be angry?
The Avatar before you? He died over a hundred years ago; how are you supposed to talk to him?
Chuckles. Cheered me up. An acorn gets thrown at him. Ow. Yeah, I probably deserved that.
Hey, who are you?
Why is it attacking you?
With a similar expression. Yeah. Brief pause. We're all going to get eaten by a spirit monster.
This isn't right. We can't sit here and cower while Aang waits for some monster to show up.
He still shouldn't have to face this alone.
It doesn't seem too interested in what he's saying. Maybe we should go help him.
That's it. He needs help. Exits the building.
Hei Bai, over here! He throws his boomerang at him, but it barely affects the monster. He runs toward it.
We'll fight him together, Aang.
Aang! Over here! Help!
What happened?
Like I seriously need to use the bathroom. Katara gives Sokka a somewhat disgusted look.
You could give us some supplies, and some money.
What? We need stuff.
What is it?
Creepy, but great.
Voice-over; Aang gasps in surprise and looks over his right shoulder and over his left, turning around in search for the origins of the voice. I think his big butt is trying to tell ya something.
Aang stares curiously. At least, not without your friends. We got your back. Momo soars up and perches atop Aang's shoulder, and Appa licks Sokka, who angrily looks at the bison. Ew!
Panicked. Yeah! And it's gaining, fast!
Can't you make Appa go any faster?
Boldly. Let's run this blockade! Both Katara and Sokka grin confidently.
Katara and Sokka each grimacing in terror. We got into the Fire Nation. Meekly. Great.
Joyous. Katara's expresses dumbfounded interest. No! I'm good. Refreshed and ready to fight some firebenders! Continues to work out and flex his body.
Instantly halts exercise. Well ... I was talking to Momo. Points to the lemur clinging to a dead tree's branch.
Close-up, top-to-bottom view of the Fire Temple. I don't see any guards.
The group tip-toes through an enormous chamber with fire-decor columns. Wait. I think I heard something.
Do you know where you're going? The two follow Aang.
Firebenders aren't our friends! Aang steps ahead of his friends, assuming an airbending posture.
Humorously mocking. Hey don't feel bad. You're only a hundred years late! Aang scowls heavily at Sokka.
Ponderously states. Five fire blasts, huh? Zoom out to show a lamplight above him. I think I can help you out.
Kneeling. Pours oil into a bag. This is a little trick I picked up from my father. I seal the lamp oil inside an animal skin casing, Shyu lights the oil soaked twine and, Picks up bag, holds it proudly before him. ta-da! Fake firebending!
Examining the explosion. Runs his finger across the black soot. I don't get it. That firebending looked as strong as any firebending I've seen.
Pleasantly. Come on Aang. Let her dream.
Troubled, questioning. How are we gonna make it out of this?
Aang sighs weakly and drops to his knees. Sokka and Katara approach Aang's sides, supportively lifting him back to his feet. We got your back.
